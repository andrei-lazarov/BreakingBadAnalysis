phone right now\\nso please leave us a message\\nHello Mr White\\nThis is AT T calling\\nAre you happy with your current\\nlongdistance service\\nBecause if youre not\\nI would definitely really really love\\nto talk to you\\nas soon as possible about\\nHello this is Walter White speaking\\nYou said he was\\npractically dead okay\\nYou said he would die any minute\\nListen I am having breakfast\\nwith my family right now\\nand I really dont appreciate\\nthese sales calls\\nWell too bad man\\nbecause guess what\\nHes still not dead\\nI went and put my ear to the RV\\nI can hear him like\\nrolling around in there all right\\nI think hes awake man\\nI think hes trying to get loose\\nWhere the hell are you\\nIm freaking out here\\n Calm down damn it\\n You gonna help me clean this

safe\\n Okay\\nYo yo yo 1 4 8 3 to the 3\\nto the 6 to the 9 representing the ABQ\\nWhat up beyotch\\nLeave it at the tone\\nSo the term chiral\\nderives from the\\nGreek word hand\\nNow the concept here being that just\\nas your left hand and your right hand\\nare mirror images of one another\\nright identical and yet opposite\\nwell so too\\norganic compounds can exist\\nas mirrorimage forms\\nof one another\\nall the way down\\nat the molecular level\\nBut although they may\\nlook the same\\nthey dont always behave the same\\nFor instance\\nFor instance\\nIm sorry For instance\\nThalidomide\\nThe righthanded isomer\\nof the drug thalidomide\\nis a perfectly fine good medicine\\nto give to a pregnant woman\\nto prevent morning sickness\\nBut make the mistake of giving\\nthat same pregnant woman\\nthe lefthanded isomer\\nof the drug thalidomide\\nand her child will be born\\nwith horrible birth defects\\nWhich is precisely what happened\\nin the 1950s\\nSo chiral chirality\\nmirrored images right\\nActive inactive good bad\\nSo\\n Yes Ben\\n Is this gonna be on the murder\\nWhat\\nIs this gonna be on the midterm\\nChirality on the midterm\\nNo no Well maybe\\nMaybe Yes you know\\nBut prepare for it to be on the midterm\\nCant hurt to know it right So\\nKnowledge is power\\nOh no Oh no no No\\nNot good Not good not good\\nWhat the\\nHey Hey Hey you\\nHey listen you\\nNo no no\\nOh God\\nOkay\\nMILFs\\nThe hell is a MILF\\nNow what\\nLock the other one out in the RV\\nHes\\n Youre sure\\n Yes\\n Youre positive\\n You know what\\n Feel free to go check\\n Good idea Maybe I should\\nbefore he too wanders off\\ndown the street\\n Okay you know what I am sick\\n All right\\nJust\\nThe one downstairs\\ntell me about him\\nOh come on Anything Something\\nStart with his name at least\\nKrazy8\\nKrazy8\\nWhat the hell does that even mean\\nI dont know man okay It means\\nlike Krazy8 okay I dont know\\nSo you work with him regularly\\nNo not him so much\\n His cousin mainly\\n Whos his cousin\\n The guy out in the RV\\n All right all right all right\\nKrazy8s one level higher\\nOne level higher\\nYeah you know\\nNot like street level Higher\\nYou know how theres like\\na Starbucks on every corner\\nKrazy8 is like the dude that sells\\nStarbucks beans\\nOkay so hes a distributor\\nOkay so is he I mean is\\nIn other words\\nwhat is his reputation for violence\\nWell he did try to kill us both\\nyesterday so theres that\\nLook what Im trying to say\\nis that hes a distributor right\\nHes a businessman\\nHes a man of business\\nIt would therefore\\nseem to follow that he is\\ncapable of acting out of\\nmutual selfinterest yes\\nWhat\\nDo you think he is capable\\nof listening to reason\\nWhat kind of reason You mean\\nDear Krazy8 hey listen\\nif I let you go you promise not to\\ncome back and waste my entire family\\nNo Colombian neckties\\nThat kind of reason\\nNo man I cant say as I have high\\nfucking hopes where thats concerned\\nWhat was that\\nWhat was what\\nWe didnt tie him up\\n Why the hell didnt we tie him up\\n Oh God\\n Because he was out cold\\n Yeah but what if hes faking it\\nYou know like if it was me\\nId be all faking being knocked out yo\\nAnd then when the coast is clear\\nId be up looking for weapons and shit\\nReady to pounce\\nNo see Now if it was me\\nand I couldnt find\\na decent enough weapon\\nI would just lie back down\\nand bide my time\\nSo now what do we do\\nYou keep asking me that\\nlike you think I have some answer\\n Well you gotta do something\\n We\\nWe have got to do something\\nand I am open to suggestions\\nMan okay\\nthis whole thing was your deal\\nDont you dare put that on me\\nYou brought those guys out there\\nThis is your responsibility\\nLike I came to you\\nbegging to cook meth\\nOh hey nerdiest old dude I know\\nyou wanna come cook crystal Please\\nId ask my diaperwearing granny\\nbut her wheelchair wouldnt fit\\nin the RV\\nWhat about the phosphate gas\\nPhosphine gas What about it\\nI mean do you think\\nit still might kill him\\nYou know with like\\na delayed reaction or something\\nI dont know\\n Youre supposed to be a scientist\\n Look\\nThis isnt even the issue\\nthat demands immediate attention\\nWe have got a body in that RV\\nAnd its getting warmer outside\\nUnderstand\\nAnd we have got to\\ndo something about that soon\\nAnd in a way that\\nno one will ever find it\\nNow that last part\\nis very very important\\nTherefore it seems to me\\nthat our best course of action\\nwould be chemical disincorporation\\nDissolving in strong acid\\nOh man thats messed up\\nI mean youre not serious\\nYou serious\\nWell whos gonna do that\\nAnd dont look at me\\nI guess well both do it together\\nNo Mr White okay\\nIm not good with dead bodies\\nLook we are in this fiftyfifty Okay\\nI guess the only other fair way\\nto go about this would be\\nthat one of us deals with\\nthe body situation\\nwhile the other one of us deals with\\nthe Krazy8 situation\\nIn a scenario like this\\nI dont suppose it is bad form\\nto just flip a coin\\n Heads or tails\\n No Ill do the body in the acid okay\\nHeads or tails\\nHeads Heads\\nBest two out of three\\nYo yo yo 1 4 8 3 to the 3\\nto the 6 to the 9 representing the ABQ\\nWhat up beyotch\\nLeave it at the tone\\nHey Mr White its me

death for like nothing\\nAnd that way that way\\nhe just kept staring at us\\nsaying\\nYoure done\\nYoure done\\nYou wanna know what that means\\nI will tell you what that means\\nThat means exactly\\nhow it sounds yo\\nAll right We are witnesses\\nWe are loose ends\\nRight now Tucos thinking\\nYeah hey\\nthey cook good meth\\nbut can I trust them\\nWhat happens when he decides no\\nIts him or us You understand\\nIt is him or us\\nHow would you do it\\n What do you mean\\n Specifically\\nhow would you do it Step by step\\nAll right\\nSay we\\nset up one last sale\\nthis is providing\\nhe doesnt decide\\nto waste us before then\\nEvery time we bring in a new batch\\nhe always\\ntests the product right\\nSo\\nas his head is down\\nyou know just giving it a snort\\nSo three shots\\n Three shots or I dont know two\\n But is it two or is it three\\n Two would probably work I guess\\n Two shots in the chest\\n Or in the face\\n Come on\\nIm just trying to

last two sponges\\nRemember the electrolytes\\nWell think about it\\nA battery is a galvanic cell\\nIts no more than an anode\\nand a cathode\\nseparated by an electrolyte right\\nRight\\nYeah well anyway\\nHere On one side\\nyou have mercuric oxide\\nand graphite\\nfrom your brake pads\\nThis is the cathode\\nThis is the positive terminal\\nThis is where the supply of current\\nflows out from you see\\nThen Here Ill show you\\nOn the opposite side is our anode\\nThis\\nIts zinc\\nIts what we find in our coins\\nand anything galvanized\\nSo the sponge is the electrolyte\\nYeah\\nWell no the potassium hydroxide\\nis the electrolyte\\nBut yes thats what Im soaking\\nthe sponges in\\nGood\\nGood And now what shall we use\\nto conduct\\nthis beautiful current with\\nWhat one particular element\\ncomes to mind\\nWire\\nCopper\\nOh I mean\\nCopper\\nRight\\nThe only question now is\\nwill this supply enough current\\nAnd how many cells will we need\\nWeve only got material

signifies\\nIt does not mean\\nthat the patient is cured\\nTo classify someone\\nas in remission\\nwe only need to determine\\nthat the tumour hasnt grown\\nThat it hasnt grown Jesus\\nTechnically speaking\\na tumour can remain\\nthe exact same size it was before\\nand the patient\\ncould still be in remission\\nNow in Walts case\\nwith a stage lll adenocarcinoma\\nId like to see I hope to see\\nat least a 25 to 35percent\\nreduction in tumour mass\\nsomething to tell me that the cancer\\nhas responded to the therapy\\nEverybody still with me\\nAnd how has my cancer responded\\nWalt

the other thing\\nwe need to discuss\\nAccording to your scan Walt\\nyou have radiation pneumonitis\\nIts okay This is fairly common\\nSee that scarylooking thing there\\nThats tissue inflammation\\nIts a reaction to your radiotherapy\\nIts usually not serious\\nbut it can produce a cough like that\\nIll prescribe some prednisone\\nTissue inflammation I\\nAre you sure about that I mean I\\nBecause the other day\\nI was coughing up some blood\\nWhat\\nYou probably have a tear\\nin your oesophagus\\nfrom coughing\\nThat can be serious\\nYou could rupture and bleed to death\\nThis is something were gonna have to\\ndeal with before you leave today\\nWait a minute When did this happen\\nWhy didnt you tell me\\nIm sorry I just\\nNo more secrets Walt\\nWith something like this\\nyou have to call me immediately\\nNow with these results\\nwere not completely out of the woods\\nBut now at least\\nwe have some options\\nthe most important of which\\nis time\\nWell have

asshole\\nWhats the upshot\\nThe upshot\\nThe upshot is that\\nI have radiation pneumonitis\\nDamn\\nActually its not\\nas bad as it sounds\\nIts a fairly common occurrence\\neasily treated\\nIn fact\\nthe news is all good\\nWhat do you mean good\\nYou mean like good good\\nWhat you mean like\\nremission good\\nRemission Not to imply Im cured\\nI still have cancer\\nBut theres been a significant\\nreduction in the tumours\\nHow significant\\nEighty percent\\nDude No way\\nNow Im not out of the woods yet\\nnot by any stretch\\nbut options is the word\\nthey keep bandying about\\nThats awesome Serious\\nThatsThats great man\\nI mean my aunt she never\\nI mean you know at your stage\\nI didnt think that could happen\\nYeah\\nMr White you kicked its ass yo\\nNo You must

we talked about\\nsealing the deal\\nAbsolutely\\nAs you know\\nmy initial diagnosis was\\nthat your cancer was inoperable\\nThat may no longer be the case\\nWe think now that a lobectomy\\nmay be a viable option\\nMaybe a pretty good option\\nDr Bravenec is one of\\nthe few surgeons in the country\\nperforming lobectomies\\nafter fulldosage radiation\\nHes got a good track record\\nPretty good\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt sounds\\naggressive\\nYes Very much so\\nUnderstand that\\nif you dont have this surgery\\nyoure just waiting\\nfor the cancer to spread\\nAnd it will\\nThrough the treatment youve had\\nweve bought you some time\\nMaybe a lot probably a little\\nbut thats all\\nIn my opinion\\nif youre willing to take some risk\\nthen this offers the best chance\\nHow much would it cost\\nI mean Im not on your insurance\\nId say between 170\\nand 200000 all in\\nFor my part Id be willing\\nto write off what I can\\nbut mine isnt even\\nthe biggest expense\\nThis is obviously a big decision\\nand you folks are gonna wanna\\ntake some time to discuss it\\nNo\\nIll do it\\nWalt dont you think we should\\nat least talk this through first\\nI just think its the way to go\\nI have to say\\nI think its the right choice\\nI recommend\\nthat we let the pneumonitis heal\\nfor another couple of weeks\\nand then well have at it\\nThats tricky\\nWhens the due date\\nIts the 21 st\\nSo two weeks and change\\nIll book the surgery\\nfor four weeks from now\\nThat way Walter can be on his feet\\nfor the birth of your daughter\\nBut I wouldnt wait any longer\\nYeah\\nFourteen

assistant\\nI take it\\n\\nYes I am\\n\\nI suppose youll want\\nto hear my qualifications\\n\\nI have my uh\\nmy resume here for you\\n\\nI received\\nmy bachelors degree from UNM\\n\\nmy masters from\\nthe University of Colorado\\n\\nOrganic chemistry\\nwith a specialty in\\n\\nIts all right there\\n\\nXray crystallography \\n\\nReally\\n\\nI could talk about that\\nfor hours\\n\\nI would love to\\n\\nWell first\\nIm curious about this\\n\\nThats a little pet project\\nof mine\\n\\nHm\\n\\nSee in my opinion\\n\\nits all about\\nthe quinic acid level\\n\\nYou want just north\\nof 4800 milligrams per liter\\n\\nbut if you overboil\\nto get there\\n\\nyoure going to leach\\nyour tannins\\n\\nBitterness Yuck\\n\\nSo I pull a mild vacuum\\n\\nThat way I can keep the temperature\\nno higher than 92 C and uh\\n\\nLets see\\n\\nJudge for yourself\\n\\nOh my God\\n\\nMy God that is the best\\ncoffee Ive ever tasted\\n\\nSumatran beans\\n\\nand I also have to give\\ncredit to the

minute\\nfor the first 10 minutes\\n\\nand then 90 for the remainder\\n\\nWhy is that\\n\\nWell my thinking is\\n\\nby tapering the phenyl you get an\\noilier aqueous layer and hence\\n\\nBetter benzene extraction\\n\\nExactly\\n\\nBut actually I prefer ether\\n\\nOh Ill have it\\nfor tomorrow\\n\\nGale Im wondering how you\\n\\nEnded up here\\n\\nWell actually\\nIm still wondering\\n\\nhow I ended up here but yes\\n\\nI mean I cant imagine\\n\\nwe strike each other\\nas criminals\\n\\nWell theres crime\\n\\nand then theres crime\\nI suppose\\n\\nIm definitely a libertarian\\n\\nConsenting adults\\nwant what they want\\n\\nand if Im not supplying it\\n\\nthey will get it\\nsomewhere else\\n\\nAt least with me theyre getting\\nexactly what they pay for\\n\\nNo added toxins or adulterants\\n\\nYeah I was doing it\\nthe way you are supposed to\\n\\npursuing my doctorate\\nat Colorado\\n\\nNSF research grant\\n\\nI was on my way\\n\\njumping through hoops\\nkissing the proper behinds\\n\\nattending\\nto allhe nonchemistry\\n\\nthat one finds oneself\\noccupied with\\n\\nYou know that world\\n\\nThat is not\\nwhat I signed on for\\n\\nI love the lab\\n\\nBecause its all still magic\\n\\nYou know\\n\\nChemistry\\n\\nI mean on you lose that\\n\\nIt is It is magic\\n\\nIt still is\\n\\nAnd all the while\\nI kept thinking\\n\\nabout that great\\nold Whitman poem\\n\\nWhen I Heard\\nthe Learnd Astronomer \\n\\nWalt Whitman\\n\\nI I dont know it\\n\\nUh anyway\\n\\nWell can you recite it\\n\\nPathetically enough I could\\n\\nAll right well\\n\\nNo no come on\\nCome on\\n\\nYeah\\n\\nWhen I heard\\nthe learnd astronomer\\n\\nWhen the proofs the figures\\n\\nwere ranged in columns\\nbefore me\\n\\nWhen I was shown the charts\\nand the diagrams\\n\\nto add divide\\nand measure them\\n\\nWhen I sitting heard the\\nastronomer where he lectured\\n\\nwith much applause\\nin the lectureroom\\n\\nHow soon unaccountable\\nI became tired and sick\\n\\nTill rising and gliding out\\n\\nI wanderd off by myself\\n\\nIn the mystical moist\\nnightair\\n\\nand from time to time\\n\\nLookd up in perfect silence\\n\\nat the stars\\n\\nYes I am a

theres\\nno honor among thieves\\n\\nExcept for us of course\\n\\nNo hell\\n\\nhell come around\\n\\nAnd if he doesnt\\n\\nthere may come a time\\nto talk options\\n\\nOptions\\n\\nIm convinced that Mr Pinkman\\nwas involved\\n\\nin the manufacture\\nand distribution\\n\\nof phenyl2\\nmethamphetamine\\n\\nspecifically what were\\ncalling the blue meth\\n\\nI tracked him to a scrap yard\\n\\nwhere he stored\\nan early 80s camper\\n\\nan RV\\n\\nWhile waiting for a warrant\\nto search this vehicle\\n\\nwhich I believed to be\\na rolling meth lab\\n\\nI received a telephone call\\n\\ntelling me my wife Marie had\\nbeen injured in an accident\\n\\nUpon hearing the news\\n\\nI left Mr Pinkman\\nand his vehicle\\n\\nto tend to my wife\\n\\nAfter arriving at the hospital\\n\\nI learned the emergency\\ncall was a hoax\\n\\nMy wife fortunately\\nwas unharmed\\n\\nSo I immediately went\\nback to the salvage yard\\n\\nbut the RV was gone\\n\\nMost likely destroyed on site\\n\\nAnd it was at this point\\n\\nthat you drove to the home\\nof Jesse Pinkman\\n\\nI think were done here\\n\\nAgent Schrader\\nneeds to get home\\n\\nget some rest\\n\\nThats fine\\n\\nBut just to confirm\\n\\nyoure taking the Fifth here\\n\\nYeah Thats correct\\n\\nOkay Well we just want\\nto GI you all a heads up\\n\\nMr Pinkman is pressing\\ncharges in this matter\\n\\nHes given a detailed version\\n\\nof events as he sees them\\n\\nThe word of a meth head\\n\\nWe know all about his history\\n\\nWere well aware\\n\\nbut toxicology on Pinkman\\n\\nhis blood is clean\\nhes not using\\n\\nThe kid is even refusing his\\ndoctorordered pain meds\\n\\nas far as we can tell\\n\\nSo um\\n\\nwhere do we go from here\\n\\nA couple of gentlemen\\nfrom OPR will come down\\n\\nprobably tomorrow

going to do it\\n\\nIve looked into this\\n\\nThe sooner physical therapy begins\\n\\nthe better his chances are\\n\\nHe needs daily sessions\\n\\nIsnt that right\\n\\nWell Actually\\n\\nyour plans treatment program\\n\\ncovers four sessions a week\\n\\nActually she asked the doctor\\n\\nPlanwise four sessions\\na week is fairly typical\\n\\nAnd the therapists in your\\nnetwork are mostly fine\\n\\nMostly fine Okay\\nTheres a ringing endorsement\\n\\nLook if Hank had\\nmore physical therapy\\n\\nwith better therapists\\n\\nwouldnt it be more\\nlikely he would walk\\n\\nIts very hard to say Marie\\n\\nIs the health plans way\\nmedically justifiable Sure\\n\\nIs it absolutely optimal\\n\\nYo5 know screw it\\n\\nIm going to make sure\\nhe gets what he needs\\n\\nand they can just\\nreimburse me later\\n\\nMrs Schrader I get your\\nfrustration Really I do\\n\\nBut my best advice is\\nstay in the network\\n\\nDont go out of pocket\\n\\nPhysical therapy is\\njust the

plan\\n\\nYeah there he is\\n\\nFinally I went ahead\\nand started without you\\n\\nLadies this is Jessesan\\nHes in for the full treatment\\n\\nKick off your shoes\\nLay back Exfoliate\\n\\nMaybe

warn him\\n\\nI believe that same\\nperson was protecting me\\n\\nThose two men the assassins\\n\\nI believe I was their prime target\\n\\nbut that somehow they\\nwere steered away from me\\n\\nto my brotherinlaw\\n\\nBecause of this intervention\\n\\nI am alive\\n\\nAnd yet I think that this person\\n\\nwas playing a much deeper game\\n\\nHe made that phone call\\nbecause he wanted a shootout\\n\\nnot a silent assassination\\n\\nIn one stroke\\n\\nhe bloodied both sides\\n\\nset the American and\\nMexican governments\\n\\nagainst the cartel\\n\\nand cut off the supply\\nof methamphetamine\\n\\nto the Southwest\\n\\nIf this man had his\\nown source of product\\n\\non this side of the border\\n\\nhe would have the\\nmarket to himself\\n\\nThe rewards would be\\n\\nenormous\\n\\nWere both adults\\n\\nI cant pretend I dont\\nknow that person is you\\n\\nI want there to be no confusion\\n\\nI know I owe you my life\\n\\nAnd more than that\\n\\nI respect the strategy\\n\\nIn your position\\n\\nI wouldnt done the same\\n\\nOne issue which troubles me\\n\\nI dont know what happens\\n\\nwhen our threemonth contract ends\\n\\nWhat would you like to

year\\n\\nCall it fifteen\\n\\nOpenended\\n\\nWould that be agreeable\\n\\nPart of the reason we talk about\\nwhat gets us riled up\\n\\nin our daily lives\\n\\nis to help each other put a finger\\n\\non what our relapse\\ntriggers might be\\n\\nhead off our disease\\nbefore it comes back\\n\\nSo anyone\\n\\nFree license to bitch and moan\\n\\nHow often do you get that\\n\\nJesse last

a lot more\\n\\nForget about money\\nAssume you have all you want\\n\\nUm\\n\\nI dont know\\n\\nI guess I would make something\\n\\nLike what\\n\\nNot that it even matters but\\n\\nwork with my hands I guess\\n\\nBuilding things like\\n\\ncarpentry or brick\\nlaying or something\\n\\nI took this votech\\nclass in high school\\n\\nwood working\\n\\nbecause it was just a big Jesus\\n\\nbut this one time\\nI had this teacher\\n\\nname of uh\\n\\nMr Pike\\n\\nI guess he was like a Marine\\nor something before he got old\\n\\nHe was hard of hearing\\n\\nMy project for his class\\n\\nwas to make this wooden box\\n\\nyou know like a small\\n\\njust like a like a box\\n\\nyou know to put stuff in\\n\\nSo I wanted to get the thing\\ndone just as fast as possible\\n\\nI figured I could cut classes\\nfor the rest of the semester\\n\\nand he couldnt flunk me\\n\\nas long as I you know\\nmade the thing\\n\\nSo I finished it in a couple days\\n\\nIt looked pretty lame\\n\\nbut it worked\\n\\nyou know for putting\\nstuff in or whatnot\\n\\nSo when I showed it to Mr Pike\\n\\nfor my grade\\n\\nhe looked at it and said\\n\\nIs that the best you can do\\n\\nAt first I thought to myself\\n\\nHell yeah bitch\\n\\nNow give me a D and shut up\\n\\nso I can go blaze\\none with my boys \\n\\nI dont know\\n\\nMaybe it was the way\\nhe said it but\\n\\nit was like he w\\n\\nhe wasnt exactly saying it sucked\\n\\nHe was just asking me honestly\\n\\nIs that all you got\\n\\nAnd for some reason\\nI thought to myself\\n\\nYeah man I can do better\\n\\nso I started from scratch\\n\\nI made another\\n\\nthen another\\n\\nand by the end of the semester\\n\\nby like box number five\\n\\nI had built this thing\\n\\nYou shouldve seen it\\n\\nIt was insane\\n\\nI mean I built it out\\nof

it\\nwas rich and dark\\n\\nIt even smelled good\\n\\nYou know you put nose in it\\n\\nand breathed in\\n\\nit was\\n\\nIt was perfect\\n\\nWhat happened to the box\\n\\nI um\\n\\nI gave it to my

every\\nanything that you need\\n\\nanything at all\\n\\nIts good to have you here\\n\\nBoth of you\\n\\nI just wish there was\\n\\nsomething more that we could do\\n\\nWalt\\n\\nWe can always pay their bills\\n\\nPlease its tens of\\nthousands of dollars\\n\\nWe have the money\\nmore than enough\\n\\nWalt earned it Skyler\\n\\nI think Marie should\\nknow the truth\\n\\nSkyler I really dont\\nthink this is a good idea\\n\\nI think that\\nHe earned it gambling\\n\\nWalt and I uh\\n\\nWeve had our problems lately\\nYou know that\\n\\nAnd uh\\n\\nwhat it all came down to\\n\\nreally was money\\n\\nPure and simple\\n\\nWhen Walt was diagnosed it um\\n\\nIt changed him\\n\\nLooking back I dont think\\nI ever really understood\\n\\nwhat it was that he\\nwas going through\\n\\nIt was more than facing death\\n\\nIt was knowing that he was\\ngoing to leave behind\\n\\nnothing\\n\\nAnd so thats how this all started\\n\\nFor better or worse\\n\\nhe wanted to provide and so\\n\\nhe paid his medical bills\\nthe only way he knew how\\n\\nI thought that Elliot and\\nGretchen paid for your treatment\\n\\nYeah I thought so too\\n\\nbut the truth is he never\\ntook their money not a dime\\n\\nHe was too proud to take\\n\\nwhat he considered to be charity\\n\\nIsnt that right\\n\\nSo he put his mindo it and\\n\\nWell you know how Walt is\\n\\nHes Hes a problem solver\\n\\nand he read books\\n\\nand he did a whole\\nbunch of research\\n\\nand he came up with\\n\\nthis system\\n\\nA system\\n\\nA system for counting\\ncards in Blackjack\\n\\nW What do you mean like Rain Man\\n\\nWell I dont pretend to understand\\nyou know all the details\\n\\nbut he was convinced\\n\\nthat if you put\\nenough money into it\\n\\nhed have a um uh\\n\\nGod what is it\\n\\nA statistical edge\\n\\nYes statistical\\n\\nSo right um yeah\\n\\nSo he Every spare minute\\n\\nWalt was at some\\ncard table somewhere\\n\\nand at first he\\nwent to the casinos\\n\\nbut then he realized that\\n\\nbut then he realized\\n\\nthat the casinos report\\nyour winnings to the IRS\\n\\nand if it gets reported\\n\\nyour family might find out\\n\\nand if you do not want\\nyour family to find out\\n\\nthen you find another\\nplace to gamble\\n\\nlike an illegal backroom game\\n\\nYou remember all those long\\nwalks that Walt used to take\\n\\nall that time he used\\nto spend away from home\\n\\nI guess for a couple\\nmonths there you were\\n\\nsort of leading a double life\\nwerent you\\n\\nOh my God\\n\\nOh my God your\\n\\nyour fugue state\\nwas that some sort of cover\\n\\nNo No\\n\\nHe did not fake that Marie\\n\\nThe night that Walt disappeared\\n\\nhe los14000\\n\\nIt was his pension fund\\n\\nour savings\\n\\nbasically every last dime\\nwe had to our name gone\\n\\nHe couldnt live with it\\n\\nHe was suicidal\\n\\nBut you have to try to understand\\n\\nthat as soon as he got\\nout of the hospital\\n\\nhe went right back to gambling\\n\\nI mean thats how deep this went\\n\\nHow could you\\n\\ndo that to her Walt\\n\\nI um\\n\\nAnyway this system of his\\n\\nhe finally got it to work\\n\\nSo all this is to say\\n\\nwe have the money\\n\\nNo more gambling\\n\\nBut we have the money\\n\\nHow much money\\n\\nWalt\\n\\nUh\\n\\nWell uh\\n\\nIts in the seven figures\\n\\nOh God Holy Mary Mother of God\\n\\nWhat can I say\\n\\nI did very well\\n\\nMarie\\n\\nyou will take our money\\n\\nUse it to take care of Hank\\n\\nPlease\\n\\nMarie let us help\\n\\nDoes Walt Jr know about this\\n\\nAbsolutely not\\n\\nand I need to keep it th way\\n\\nand Hank okay\\n\\nHanks got enough on\\nhis mind right now\\n\\nso can we just please keep this\\nbetween us Yeah Yeah I\\n\\nYeah I\\n\\nI just I need to\\n\\nYeah okay\\n\\nWell talk about

when\\nI was coming up it was just possum\\nYou know opossum makes it sound\\nlike hes Irish or something\\nI mean why they gotta go\\nchanging everything\\nWhatever Its just big rats anyways\\nGiant pinktailed rats\\nwith their pink rat faces\\nTotally freaky like alien rats\\nActually its not so much\\nthat he got trapped\\nbut he was living there\\nyou know under the house\\nYou could hear him going from\\nlike room to room\\nalways scurrying around\\nSometimes Id see him outside at night\\nand it would just you know freeze\\nI mean its like youre not looking\\nright at it right\\nI mean it thinks its fooling you\\nThats what they do\\nI mean they play dead or whatever\\nIts just so lame\\nIs there a discernible point\\nto this story\\nA point that youll be arriving at\\nsometime in the near future\\nIt was just a total bitch to get out\\nYou know it took forever\\nGuy came set all these traps and all\\nand he finally got it\\nBut my aunt you know\\nshe didnt believe it\\nI mean she kept insisting\\nshe could still hear the thing\\nI mean you could not tell her\\nany different\\nShe started keeping an old umbrella\\nyou know by her chair\\nMan she would just bang on the floor\\nand yell at it\\nEven gave it a name\\nIt was Scrabble\\nYeah that was it\\nYou know\\nScrabble just knock it off\\nShe got like that toward the end\\nGot obsessive about stuff\\nJust got mad about stuff\\nWe didnt know what was up\\nIt wasnt like her to be that way\\nBut it turned out that the cancer\\nhad spread to her brain\\nand that was why\\nIt metastasised\\nBut it was good that that was when\\nwe decided to take her to the doctor\\nbecause then we knew\\nwhat was up\\nYou know got her some treatment\\nMeds so she wasnt stressing\\nall the time\\nIt was a lot better after that\\nYou know she was a lot happier\\nWhere the hell is he\\nIve been to my oncologist Jesse\\njust last week\\nIm still in remission\\nIm healthy\\nOkay so good Great\\nWell\\nno end in sight\\nThats great\\nWell\\nI missed it\\nThere was some perfect moment\\nand it passed me right by\\nI had to have enough to leave them\\nThat was the whole point\\nI mean none of this\\nNone of this makes any sense\\nif I didnt have enough\\nBut it had to be\\nbefore she found out Skyler\\nIt had to be before that\\nPerfect moment for what\\nTo drop dead\\nWhat you saying you wanna die\\nIm saying Ive lived too long\\nI mean\\nyou want them to actually miss you\\nyou know\\nYou want their memories of you\\nto be\\nBut she just wont\\nShe just wont understand\\nI mean no matter how

talk about\\nWater on Mars\\nFamily\\nWhat about family\\nI told him that I had a daughter\\nand he told me he had one too\\nThen he said\\nNever give up on family\\nAnd I didnt\\nI took his advice\\nThe universe is random\\nIts not inevitable\\nIts simple chaos\\nIts subatomic particles\\nin endless aimless collision\\nThats what science teaches us\\nBut what is this saying\\nWhat is it telling us when on the very\\nnight that this mans daughter dies\\nits me whos having a drink\\nwith him\\nI mean how can that be random\\nHey come on Hey sit down\\nNo no No its\\nNo No\\nNo that was

new\\nevery time she painted it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd thats not psycho to you\\nWell then why should we\\ndo anything more than once\\nShould I just smoke\\nthis one cigarette\\nMaybe we should only

happened\\nDo you even know Walt\\nI mean\\nhow would he of all people\\nbuy a laser tag business\\nIt doesnt add up\\nIt adds up perfectly\\nWalts a scientist\\nScientists love lasers\\nPlus they got

little mistake\\none slipup in our story\\nthat could ruin us\\nFine\\nGot to destroy the evidence\\nWhen I look at this\\nThis image\\nthat is part of the record\\nI am very concerned about\\nwhat sort of distraction\\nthat can be\\nwhether its from any\\nsort of signage\\nbut especially a signage\\nthats changing\\nevery five seconds\\nThank you\\nAny other questions\\nWe have a motion\\nand a second on the floor\\nto grant the appeal\\nAll those in favor\\nraise your hand and say yes\\nYes is for the affirmative\\nThose opposed\\nTheres five nos\\nand that motion fails\\nI would like to

back\\nWell\\nOkay\\nLets do this\\nOkay so first I assign\\npoint values\\ncorrelate\\nto the effect of removal\\nYou going to split the 8s\\nSkyler please\\nNow\\nthe mathematical principle\\nknown as the Kelly Criterion\\nupon which I devised\\nmy own strategy\\nnot dissimilar\\nto the MIT system\\nWalt\\nyoure not teaching them\\nI thought you wanted me\\nto be thorough\\nJust play\\nYoure taking too long\\nWhat you dont think\\nit behooves me\\nto be able to explain\\nany of this\\nIt behooves you to be a pro\\nthats all Im saying\\nThats the fiction\\nso chopchop\\n Dont chopchop me\\n Walt\\nNow we both know\\nthat the first decision\\nis whether or not to split\\nor surrender on\\n8s Split em\\nMmhmm\\nGood on both\\nNext decision is whether\\nto double down or not\\nWhat you should be doing\\nOn 11 yes Double\\nOkay this hand over\\nhere we have a soft 18\\nThe final decision is whether\\nor not is to hit or to stand\\nHit it\\nBecomes a hard 15\\nDealer has a 9\\nI see that\\nHit it\\nOh\\nOkay lets see what I got\\nAnd 21\\nDamn\\nYep\\nOkay this\\nThe key thing to remember here\\nis that its not about\\nany one hand\\nThe key is the number\\nof hands per hour\\nOoh\\nLets go again\\nZero minus 1\\nOkay\\nWalt\\nIts not as if I dont\\nknow how to play\\nI certainly more than\\nunderstand how to count cards\\nLets just keep going okay\\nNo you know what\\nIm in recovery\\nRemember\\nI shouldnt even be playing\\nAnd that is the fiction\\nthat we should be sticking to\\nYou know what\\nYoure right\\nYeah\\n Wow\\n Okay Um\\nwere not leaving\\nanything to chance\\nAll right lets get started\\nIve got a lot of uh\\nWalt\\nweve got a lot\\nof ground to cover\\nWhat is this\\nWe have to get\\nour stories straight\\nWeve got to be\\non the same page\\n Is this a script\\n Bullet points\\nBullet points\\nLike a novella\\nThis is smart\\nYou really want to try\\nto sell a DEA agent some\\nillprepared halfassed\\nfullofholes story\\nabout how we suddenly\\nhave enough money\\n to buy a car wash\\n Am I supposed to memorize this\\n We need to practice Walt\\n Yeah\\nWe need to be\\nwordperfect\\n Within reason\\n We need this story to be solid\\nand sympathetic and most of\\nall completely believable\\nA story that you\\nalready told Marie\\nand you think that she\\nhasnt told Hank\\nHa Come on This is Marie\\nwere talking about here\\nNo she hasnt\\nShe hasnt\\nHank thinks his insurance\\nis paying for everything\\nMaries not telling him\\nthat were paying his therapy\\nbills and neither are we\\nAnd why is that again\\nReally\\nIf we have\\nthe gambling story\\nDid you take money Walt\\nYou remember\\nGretchen and Elliot\\nBecause I seem to recall that\\nyoud rather sell drugs than take help\\nFine\\nMarie will tell Hank\\nin her own time\\nand at least well have\\nlaid the groundwork\\nAnd coming clean\\nwith Hank and Jun\\nAppearing to come clean\\nwill be the best thing\\nfor everyone\\nWe talked about this okay\\nWe agreed about this\\nYes we did Its just\\nWhat\\nNever mind Just\\nOkay\\nSo I really think\\nwe should tag team\\nthe narrative okay\\nWell each be responsible\\nfor certain portions\\nof the story\\nand then we can uh\\nwe can hand off\\nso we dont leave anything out\\nand itll seem\\nthe most natural\\nOkay so Im going to launch\\nwith the exciting news\\nthat we are\\nbuying a car wash\\nYay\\nThe next logical question\\nHank will probably ask\\nis Where are you\\ngetting the money\\nHmm\\nTo which Ill say\\nWe want to tell you\\nthe whole story\\nIts a doozy\\nso hold on\\nto your hats\\nDo you like that\\nSure\\nIt accomplishes two things\\nIt keeps it light\\nwhile letting them know\\nto expect something big\\nUhhuh\\nYeah No Its a doozy\\nHmm\\nOkay\\nAnyway thats where\\nyou will take over\\nstarting with your diagnosis\\npages 1 and 2\\nOkay and its\\nIts pretty much\\ngoing to run parallel\\nto the truth\\nwhich makes it easier\\nbut um\\njust make sure to really\\nhit the cancer\\nreally touch\\non the fear and despair\\nIts good to remind them\\nand to get their sympathy\\nright off the bat\\nWe want them to understand\\nwhy you could do\\nsomething so stupid\\nNow after that\\nper pages 3 and 4\\nafter you say\\nGambling became an addiction\\nand I just\\ncouldnt control it\\nDo you see that\\nYes\\nRight there in the\\nmiddle of the page Okay\\nOh and I put in\\nthat line about robbery\\nYou know\\nfrom the GA meeting\\nI thought that was good\\nSo next Ill chime in\\nabout how it affected\\nour marriage\\nuh starting with the confusion\\nuh the deceit\\nwhy we couldnt tell anyone\\nterribly terribly\\nashamed of my actions\\nYeah\\nTheres two terriblys\\nIts supposed\\nto show contrition\\nWell I just wouldnt\\nuse that word\\nI would never say\\nthe word terribly\\nPhrase it however\\nyou want okay\\nYoure jumping ahead\\nNow\\nAnd why\\nWhy am I so ashamed\\nDo I really need\\nto answer that\\nI was and am providing\\nfor our family\\nLets just pick up\\nwhere we left off\\nIm weak\\nand Im out of control\\nI mean this whole thing\\nmakes me look like crap\\nThis has to be\\na wartsandall story Walt\\nThats how well sell it\\nand we both look bad\\nOh well How do you\\nlook bad exactly\\nWhere is the I slept\\nwith my boss bullet point\\nI cant seem to find that\\nanywhere\\nFor a fired schoolteacher\\nwho cooks crystal meth\\nId say youre coming out\\npretty much ahead\\nI dont like it\\nI dont want Junior\\nthinking less of me\\nAt least you won at gambling\\nIm just the bitch mom\\nwho wouldnt cut you any slack\\nIm sorry\\nIm sorry that I put you\\nthrough all of this\\nHows that sound Hmm\\nHere\\nTwo sorrys\\nI believe we were on page 5\\nSo

dont know\\nMaybe\\nWhen you dab your eyes\\nyou going to do it\\nwith your right hand\\nor your left\\nIts just an idea\\nOne tear Two tears\\nThis has to be convincing\\nespecially to Hank\\nIm

unknown\\nNow this Gale Boetticher is\\na bona fide chemistry genius\\nI mean hes got degrees\\nup the wazoo right\\nAnd uh as you might expect\\nhes a nerds nerd\\nVegan sandals and socks\\nkind of

little Googlefu\\nand I I realize\\nits a parts number\\nspecifically for this baby\\nNow that there\\nis a highvolume\\nHEPA industrial\\nair filtration system\\nThats a 300000 gadget\\nPerfect\\nfor a pharmaceutical plant\\nor microchip factory\\nor maybe the biggest meth lab\\nnorth of the border\\nOkay\\nSo this little dingus here\\nis manufactured\\nby a big\\ninternational concern\\nMadrigal

restaurants\\na few days ago\\nId eat there every day\\nbut I wouldnt fit through the door\\nWell should we get started\\nYeah\\nId like to record\\nthis conversation\\nif thats okay\\nOf course\\nThe DEA is working\\non an investigation\\nwhich may overlap with my own\\nso Ive asked them\\nto sit in with us today\\nGus we all appreciate\\nyour coming in here\\nto talk to us\\nbut you have the right to have\\nan attorney present also\\nOh well I cant see how\\nthat would be necessary\\nBut then again I have\\nno idea why Im here\\nSo you wish to continue\\nPlease\\nIm very anxious\\nto find out what this\\nis all about\\nSir your fingerprints\\nwere found at a crime scene\\nReally\\nThats surprising\\nA drugrelated homicide\\nGale Boettichers apartment\\nSo you knew the victim\\n15 years ago I established\\na chemistry scholarship at UNM\\nI named it after\\nMaximino Arsiniega\\na dear friend of mine\\nwho died too young\\nGale was a recipient\\nof this scholarship\\nHe was uh perhaps\\none of three dozen\\nI see\\nAnd Mr Boetticher\\ngraduated in\\n1999\\nThat sounds right\\nAnd you kept in regular\\ncontact with him\\nover all this time\\nOh no I hadnt\\nseen Gale for years\\nuntil I ran into him\\na few weeks ago\\nRan into him where\\nAt the restaurant\\nUh well ran into\\nisnt quite accurate\\nas I assume he came by\\nto reestablish\\ncontact with me\\nWe caught up briefly\\nHe invited me to dinner\\nthe following night\\nand I accepted\\nIt was uh perhaps a week later\\nI read about him in the paper\\nDrug related you said\\nIts a good possibility\\nThe paper made\\nno mention of that\\nI assumed that it was\\na random crime\\nSo after years with no contact\\nhe shows up in your restaurant\\nremakes your acquaintance\\nand invites you to dinner\\nYeah he wanted money\\nGale Boetticher\\nasked you for money\\nHe didnt come right\\nout and say that\\nHe spoke in terms of\\na vague investment\\nopportunity\\nbut it was my suspicion yes\\nas to why he invited me\\ninto his home\\nHe was a very talented chemist\\nbut for reasons\\nI never understood\\nhe was more interested\\nin taking shortcuts\\nthan what would\\nor could have been\\na very promising career\\nBut personal shortcomings\\nnotwithstanding\\nhe was a warm gentle person\\nand I thought a lot of him\\nAt any rate I uh\\ndeclined his business offer\\nand after what was\\na very pleasant meal left\\nCan you tell us where you were\\non the night of Wednesday\\nthe 23rd\\nat around 8 pm\\nNot an accusation\\njust a question\\nOh I understand\\nLets see\\n23rd\\nAh\\nI was at a fundraiser\\nat Presbyterian Hospital\\nI was there from 7 to about 10\\nAnyone else\\nUh sorry yeah\\nJust uh just one other thing Uh\\nis Gustavo Fring\\nyour real name\\nIs it my real name\\nI know youre a Chilean national but\\nthere are no records\\nof you ever living there\\nReally\\nI mean records show that you\\nimmigrated to Mexico\\nin 1986 and then\\na couple of years later\\nyou were granted an entry visa\\nto the United States\\nBut theres no record\\nof Gustavo Fring\\never having existed in Chile\\nwhich I find\\nI dont know uh strange\\nWell really it isnt\\nGeneral Pinochets\\ngovernment was guilty\\nof a great many sins\\nFirst and foremost were\\nhis human rights abuses\\nBut it was also\\nnotoriously unreliable\\nat keeping records\\nIm sure if you keep\\ndigging youll find me\\nOkay\\nI think thats it Gus\\nUh thank you\\nI hope that I was\\nof some small help\\nYou were absolutely\\nThank you\\nYoure very welcome\\nGood to see you again\\nOh no No please please\\nThank you\\nThanks\\nGentlemen\\nSo Are we buying\\nThis thing with his name\\nwhat are you thinking there\\nSure the record keeping\\nin South America\\nis hit or miss I mean\\nwe run into that\\nall the time right\\nWe usually find something\\nI mean before 86\\nthis guys a ghost\\nIf the State Department\\nwasnt satisfied with his records\\nthey wouldnt have\\nnaturalized him\\nWell maybe but\\nhe immigrated\\nfrom Mexico in 89\\nYou know the state just wasnt\\nas tough on background checks\\npre911\\nRegardless I dont know\\nwhat this has to do\\nwith the case at hand\\nI was definitely curious\\nwhen his prints show up\\nat Boettichers apartment\\nbut for me the scholarship\\nthing explains it\\nWell Ill admit\\nto a certain degree of bias\\nThis man has been\\na longtime friend of DEA\\nbut that being said uh\\nI thought his story was credible\\nWell I agree I think\\nit was a good story\\nStill why are we hearing it now\\nWhat do you mean\\nWell\\nlike you said hes a\\nthis mans a big\\nlaw enforcement booster\\nOne day hes reading\\na newspaper and\\nsees that somebody\\nhe just had dinner with\\nsomebody he thought\\na lot of was murdered\\nHe reads this and he\\ndoesnt make a phone call\\nDidnt call you or one of\\nhis other cop friends to\\nshare his connection\\nwith the case or\\nask about the investigation\\nWe cant predicate\\na criminal investigation\\non a person\\nnot making phone calls\\nWhat do you think Tim\\nWell I want to follow up\\non the scholarship the alibi\\nBut my overall impression\\nI believed him\\nNice touch Bird bath\\nHey tiger\\nHows it hanging\\nGood\\nYeah So very nice\\nWhats the damage\\n1200 a month\\nI did a lot of researching\\nfor this neighborhood\\nIts a pretty good deal\\nYou kidding me\\nThats a great deal\\nUh speaking of which ahem\\nThats for the week\\nplus theres a little\\nextra in there for any\\nmoverelated

sack\\nfrom the karaoke video tape\\nYeah\\nAnd you said\\nthat he didnt strike you\\nas being the bossman type\\nthat probably there was\\na much bigger guy\\n out there right\\n Hank that was\\nthat was just speculation\\nDidnt matter\\nIt made me keep at it\\nAnd guess what I find\\nChicken mans fingerprints\\nat Boettichers murder scene\\nSo we bring him in\\nYou think that\\nthat Gustavo Fring\\nkilled Gale Boetticher\\nWell probably not\\nI mean these guys use\\nyou know like\\na dunce\\nto pull the trigger right\\nBut his fingerprints being there\\nwas enough for us to bring him in\\nSo I\\nSo you brought him in to the police\\nRight He sits down\\nto talk with us\\nThe problem is that he\\nWhat did you ask him\\nWhat did he say\\nWalt will you let me\\nfinish my story

backs\\nmake sure we dont\\nthrow him any bones\\nhell never make a case\\nWhat about Chile\\nIf I cant find any trace\\nof you before 89\\nI seriously doubt Schrader can\\nSeems to me the bigger\\nproblems the cartel\\nWe can handle them if thats\\nall weve got on our plate\\nBut dealing with both Schrader\\nand the Mexicans\\nat the same time\\nif he happens to be watching\\nwhen they make a move\\nthey could be the perfect storm\\nThank you\\nIll be in touch\\nHello Hector\\nThe cartel has given me\\nits ultimatum\\nto which Ive said no\\nDEA agent Schrader\\nuh hes a

chef\\nThe compliments are all his\\nEh Gustavo is too modest\\nThered be no restaurant\\nwithout him\\nWell however you two\\ndo it keep it up\\nYour chicken its so zesty\\nPiquant\\nBut it does not taste\\nlike a Mexican style\\nIts a recipe I learned in Chile\\nwhich Ive modified a bit\\nfor the Mexican palate\\nI bet we like a little more chili\\nthan you Chileans\\nWe Mexicans like a good hard kick\\n Sit down please\\n Thank you\\nThen\\nSo if your partner is the chef\\nthen who are you\\nDont tell me you are\\njust the taster\\nOh I handle the\\nbusiness operations\\nGustavo is a brilliant\\nbusinessman\\nHes the businessman\\nGood good\\nBut tell me something\\nThat chicken so fabulous\\nso excellent\\nBesides that what else\\ndo you have on your menu\\nWe have several side dishes\\nRice Beans\\nSometimes we prepare\\na carnitas entre\\nif we come across fresh beef\\nin the market\\nAnything else\\nCome on be honest\\nThere is nothing else you offer\\nA little taste of something else\\nSomething on the side\\nBecause when I send my men\\nto your restaurant\\nthey come back\\nwith more than just chicken\\nThey come back with drugs\\nThey get back high\\nRight You are selling\\nthem narcotics\\nMethamphetamine\\nWith all due respect Don Eladio\\nI didnt sell it to them\\nI gave them samples\\nSamples\\nSome businessman\\nI gave them samples\\nto give to you\\nTo introduce you to our product\\nDon Eladio Gustavo\\nmeant no offense\\nBut he that is to say we\\ncould think of no other way\\nto get your attention\\nAnd We want to work\\nwith you Don Eladio\\nI know all about methamphetamine\\nLike you\\nThats poor mans cocaine\\nOnly bikers and hillbillies use it\\nTheres no money in it\\nMay I Don Eladio\\nI am a biochemist by training\\nThe methamphetamine\\nwe make is much superior\\nto the socalled biker crank\\nyou know of\\nIt is crystallized like glass\\nand purer\\nThe chirality of the molecule\\nis different\\nits very structure is different\\nThe narcotic effect\\nis far more potent\\nDon Eladio this product\\nis the drug of the future\\nItll triple your profits\\nPerhaps quadruple\\nTheyre not only good cooks\\ntheyre great at\\nshoveling manure\\nNo no no\\nContinue continue\\nRight now you deal almost\\nexclusively with cocaine\\nBut the coca plant\\ncant grow in Mexico\\nYou are no more\\nthan middlemen\\nfor the Colombians\\nThey cut you a percentage for\\nsmuggling across the border\\nBut the lions share\\nof the profits goes to them\\ndespite your assumption\\nof all the risk\\nDon Eladio this new\\ncrystal methamphetamine\\nits stronger more\\naddictive than cocaine\\nwhich means it will\\nmove in higher volume\\nBut most importantly\\nits completely artificial\\nWe can show you\\nhow to manufacture it\\nright here in Mexico\\nAnd you keep all the profits\\nMy men do like your product\\nHector what is wrong with you\\nWhy did you not get glasses\\nfor our guests\\nGo on\\nGood you are quite the talent\\nI bet you learned cooking\\nfrom your mama Right\\nBut what about the chemistry\\nI studied at the University\\nof Santiago Don Eladio\\nGustavo paid for my education\\nOh really\\nI have degrees in both biochemistry\\nand chemical engineering\\nWith minimal capital investment\\nwe can set up a\\nfactorygrade laboratory for you\\nTrain your own people\\nto manufacture large quantities\\nof highly pure methamphetamine\\nFantastic\\nTell me one thing though\\nIf youre the cook\\nWhy do I need him\\nSeor\\nYou\\nBusinessman\\nWhy should I negotiate with someone\\nwho doesnt respect me\\nWho insults me by dealing\\nunder my nose without my permission\\nWho manipulates me into a meeting\\nin front of my own men\\nWhat do I need you for\\nDon Eladio Please\\nI didnt sell anything\\nI apologize if you are offended\\nby my method\\nof obtaining this meeting\\nI merely took the initiative\\nI meant no insult\\nDon Eladio Gustavo\\ndidnt mean to offend\\nI know Gustavo like a brother\\nHes an honorable man\\nThe most loyal man\\nI have ever known\\nHe rescued me\\nfrom the Santiago slums\\nHe made me the man I am today\\nDon Eladio Gustavo is a genius\\nHe will make you millions\\nJust find it in your heart to forgive him\\nthis one small mistake\\nPlease\\nHes my partner\\nI need him I swear to God\\nPlease\\nLook at him\\nYou did this to him\\nNow look at him\\nListen to me\\nThe only reason you are alive\\nand he is not\\nis because I know who you are\\nBut understand\\nYou are not in Chile anymore\\nMy advice\\nStick to chicken\\nLook at me Hector\\nLook at me\\nMaybe next timeI got it I got it\\nYoure like a bee at a damn picnic\\nMarie\\n Morning\\n Hey buddy\\n Ready to get your rocks on\\n See I knew it\\nMineral show is just some

here right\\nBecause its totally logical for him\\nto off the dude\\nAhole DEA agent\\npoking around your junk\\nWho needs that right\\nMakes sense to get rid of him\\nfor good\\nBut killing a cop\\nI dont know\\nIt could look suspicious\\nif the dude whos investigating you\\nsuddenly up and dies\\nThen theres Theres Mr White\\nwho would be even more apeshit\\nif he had family getting murdered\\nHed never cook for Gus again\\nGuess theres a lot of angles\\nto consider\\nIf something were to happen to him\\nwould you have a problem with that\\nWho really cares what I think\\nSon of a bitch\\nYou get comfortable kid\\nWe may be here a while\\nHey\\nGet down\\nTell them\\nthe answer is yes\\n Should I even ask\\n I wouldnt\\nSo what Is this going to be\\na regular thing now\\nMeth cooking and corpse disposal\\nJesus\\nJust grab us a spare barrel\\nWalter\\nWhat was it this time\\nWhat did this poor bastard do\\nto piss off Gus\\nOr did Gus need to send\\nanother message\\nShut

What was the deal with Gus\\n The deal\\nThat Terminator shit\\nWalking right into the bullets\\nWhat the hell was he doing\\nThe cartel needs Gus\\nHis distribution network\\nTheyre not looking to kill him\\nBut what The rest of us are like\\nopen season\\nIs he doing anything about that\\nor do we keep hanging out\\n for target practice while he\\n Kid\\nEnough You got questions\\nask him yourself\\nAnd here again\\nUnreported income\\nThats more than a year straight so far\\nYou want to say something about this\\nIm having a hard time figuring it out\\nId have to\\nhave a look at the

time\\nI was sure that\\nGus did what he did\\nto send me a message\\nMaybe theres another reason\\nLike what\\nVictor trying to cook\\nthat batch on his own\\nTaking liberties\\nthat werent his to take\\nMaybe he flew\\ntoo close to the sun\\ngot his throat cutGotta say when you first brought\\nher in I had my doubts\\nBut your little darlings\\ngot nine lives\\nRearwheel assembly took the brunt\\nof the impact So\\nYeah\\nCV shaft boots joints axle\\nReplaced all of it\\nNo way around it\\nI went aftermarket\\non most of the parts here\\nYou want me to swap in\\nfactory parts thats

Absolutely\\nWell look after them for a day\\nor two or however long\\nand leave you and Skyler\\nto look after each other\\nThats very generous\\nof you Marie\\nbut I I just dont see\\nhow thats a

will not have my children\\nliving in a house\\nwhere dealing drugs and hurting\\npeople and killing people\\nis shrugged off as\\nshit happens\\nWere back at it Fine\\nBut the kids stay away\\nand

say\\n that they are not in\\n I said no\\nI swear to God\\nI wont have them back here\\nWhat are you gonna do to stop it\\nWhatever it takes\\nEverything in my power\\nLike what I mean specifically\\nWhat is your next move\\nMy next move is maybe I hurt myself\\nMake it clear we need more time\\nLet Hank and Marie see\\nwere still struggling\\nNo more like youre still struggling So\\nmaybe next time I have you committed\\nPut you in some inpatient facility\\nwhile I take care of the kids myself\\nIs that what you want\\nSo then maybe I show up\\nwith bruises on my neck\\ngive myself a black eye\\nsay that you beat me\\nwhen you found\\nout about my lover\\nI see\\nSo you want to involve Ted\\nOh well thatll be fun\\nbringing the police\\nup to speed on all of that\\nBut not as much fun as\\ntelling your 16yearold son\\nthat his father is a wifebeater\\nAlso not a very good plan\\nWhat else you got\\n I could send Junior away to school\\n Now heres the conversation\\nSo honey I know youve only got\\none year left in high school\\nbut I would love it\\nif youd drop everything\\nleave all your friends behind and\\ngo to boarding school in Arizona\\nYou have any other ideas\\nBecause Im not hearing\\na solution to your problem\\nHow are you going to save our kids\\nfrom this terrible environment\\n I dont\\n What are you gonna do\\nRun

best\\nI could come up with okay\\nI will count every minute\\nthat the kids are away from here\\naway from you as a victory\\nBut youre right\\nIts a bad plan\\nI dont have any of\\nyour magic Walt\\nI dont know what to do\\nIm a coward\\nI I cant go to the police\\nI cant stop laundering your money\\nI cant keep you out of this house\\nI cant even keep you out of my bed\\nAll I can do is

new\\nmethylamine hookup is rare man\\nIts like Bigfoot\\nLike unicornrare\\nKid its just\\nYoure giving me heartburn here\\nGPS on the bottom of the barrel\\nWhy didnt they put it inside\\nwhere nobody would see it\\nLook its inside it gets wet\\nThey made these things\\nto put under cars\\nIt can get wet\\nEven by cop standards\\nthis is sloppy\\nAnd the other barrels\\nthey have trackers\\non the outside too\\nI dont know Probably\\nYou didnt check\\nany of the other barrels\\nNo But thats the only one\\nwe couldve taken according to her\\nOnce we spotted it she freaked out

our business\\nelsewhere\\nright after I leave\\nher alone in a ditch\\nBut wait hey if the DEAs\\nnot tracking her stuff\\nthats a good thing right\\nI mean all we gotta do is tell her\\nto cut the crap\\nand keep the methylamine coming\\nYou dont know this woman like I do\\nI had a chance to deal with this\\nbefore and I gave her a pass\\nThats what I get for being sexist\\n Now if youll excuse me\\n Mike you cant just\\nLook thats our precursor\\nWe need her\\nKid if we have to ramp down\\nfor a while so be it\\nIt beats working with a lunatic whos\\ngonna get us arrested or killed\\nLook

running\\nYeah Computers set\\nOkay Lydia\\nIf you ever needed to give\\nthe performance of a lifetime\\nits now\\nYoure up\\nA SA C s office\\nHi Lydia RodarteQuayle\\ncalling for Agent Schrader\\nIm sorry Whats this regarding\\nMadrigal Electromotive\\nLydia Rodarte Quayle\\nHold please\\nHank Lydia RodarteQuayle\\non line one\\nHank Schrader\\nHow can I help you Ms Quayle\\nWell this is kind of an odd\\nIts just that I was in our warehouse\\nsupervising a shipment of chemicals\\nwhen I noticed a device on the bottom\\nof one of our barrels of methylamine\\n A device\\n Yeah I guess youd call it that I mean\\nIm certainly no expert but it\\nlooks to me like some kind of a\\nA tracking device or a GPS\\nSo I was just wondering\\nif maybe your people put it there\\nNot that its any of my business but\\nthe last thing I wanna do is interfere\\nwith a law enforcement operation\\nor a sting\\nor whatever you call it\\nSo I dont know\\nmaybe you could\\ngive me some guidance\\nWell Ill tell you what\\nSet that barrel aside for me\\nif you would\\nand Ill look into it\\nand get back to you\\nAnd in the meantime\\nmums the word all right\\nYeah All right Sure thing\\nOkay great\\nThanks for the call Ms Quayle\\nByebye\\nHey Gomey come here would you\\n Yeah\\n Hey man\\nYou know anything about GPS trackers\\non a methylamine barrel\\nMadrigal Houston Im talking about\\nNope Nobody from my team\\nplanted anything Why\\nOh I dont know I figured as much\\nAll right Thanks\\nI know what youre thinking\\nbut I didnt do it\\n Im telling you I didnt plant that thing\\n Shut up\\nAnd there you have it like I said\\nAll right So now what\\nIts not the DEAs so Schraders\\nprobably thinking some crew planted it\\nlooking for a weak spot\\nto pull a heist\\nHes gonna send a team\\nover to that warehouse\\nHes gonna wire it out the wazoo\\nBugs cameras the whole nine yards\\nSo the warehouse is too hot\\nHer supply is useless to us now\\nIt depends on how fast Schrader\\ncan get his guys there\\nWere 900 miles closer after all\\nI say we keep listening\\nsuss out how much time we have\\nIf its at least 12 hours\\nthen we head down there\\nuse her security code\\nto gain access\\nand we take every barrel we can\\nUHaul can only take six or seven\\nbefore the suspension gives out\\nIts a stopgap But right now\\nits the best we can do\\nWell what about her\\nYou two drive the\\nbarrels back tonight\\nIll deal with her\\nNo No no no\\nYoure making a mistake\\nThis was not me\\nI swear to God I didnt do it\\nI dont know Sounds like shes\\ntelling the truth to me\\nShe has a gun to her head kid\\nEveryone sounds like Meryl Streep\\nwith a gun to their head\\nIm sorry Jesse\\nYoure the one who wanted\\nto put it up to a vote\\nIts two against one\\nNo No You cant kill me Come on\\nI swear I didnt do anything\\nJanice give me Doughty\\nin the Houston office will you\\nYou got it\\nHank Schrader for Mr Doughty\\nHes on the line\\nHey Erol Please tell me you guys\\ndidnt do something as lamebrained\\nas put a GPS tracker on the\\noutside of a barrel of methylamine\\nOne earmarked for the\\nMadrigal warehouse in Houston\\nWhos asking\\nDid someone find them\\nJesus Are you shitting me\\nSince when do you put a GPS tracker\\n on the outside of a barrel\\n We didnt have time to go in\\nwith hazard suits Hank\\nThey were about to ship\\nWe epoxied them to the bottom\\nThey were wellhidden\\nOh really Well not wellhidden\\nenough How many barrels you tag\\nAll of them All the ones\\nheaded to the warehouse anyway\\nChrist All right Well sit tight\\nLet me figure out how to play this\\nNext time a little\\ncommunication first all right\\n Yeah Im sorry about that\\n Asshole\\nAside Aside from the fact\\nthat we almost killed this woman\\nall of those barrels are already marked\\nWe solve the problem we can\\nThis has not changed the equation\\none iota for her\\nOh come on You are not seriously\\nstill considering killing me\\nI saved you If it werent for me\\nwed all be in jail right now\\nI hate to say it\\nbut shes right Mike\\nShe saved our asses\\nby finding that thing\\nShe is saving herself\\nShes a loose cannon\\nI am telling you she will turn a gun or\\na badge on us the first chance she gets\\nThe woman put a hit out on me\\nSeriously\\nWait A hit What Like the mafia\\nYeah like the mafia\\nHey You still need methylamine\\ndont you Right\\nYou wanna talk methylamine\\nThen tell your partner to stop\\nthreatening me and lets talk\\nTalk about what You heard\\nYou cant even get\\nus a single barrel\\nWho said anything about barrels\\nIm talking about an ocean\\nof the stuff\\nJust give him a minute would you\\nTrust him\\nTrust him\\nOkay So lets hear it\\nNot without a guarantee that once\\nI tell you how to get what you want\\n I wont be killed anyway\\n Fine You have my word\\n Not good enough\\n Look lady\\n Do you have children\\n That has nothing to do with this\\nIts not a trick question\\nWhy dont you just answer it\\nYes I have children So what\\nYou think that somehow\\nbecause were both parents\\nthat I wont let my partner\\ndo whats necessary\\n Swear on their lives\\n Oh what\\nSwear on your childrens lives\\nthat I wont be harmed\\nOtherwise how can I trust you\\nLook youre a smart businesswoman\\nYou understand the concept\\nof leverage\\n Please dont patronize me I hate that\\n You have none\\nBut trust has to work\\nboth ways Lydia\\nIs it true that you put\\na hit out on Mike\\n Yes\\n Why\\nI was scared\\n Of Mike\\n Not at first\\nThere are men who used to work\\nwith Gus Fring in custody now\\nNine of them They know everything\\nabout me Everything\\nSome of them even know about you\\nassuming youre the master chemist\\ntheyre always talking about\\nAnd if its these nine\\nthat youre worried about\\n why put the hit on Mike\\n I had no choice\\nIm not going to prison and have my\\ndaughter raised in a group home\\nDo you have any idea\\nwhat those places are like\\nI gave him a list of names\\nbut instead of handling it\\nhes protecting them\\nSo I hired someone else\\nAt that point there was no option\\nbut to add Mike to the list\\nThis ocean of methylamine\\nthat you claim\\nyou can get your hands on\\nhow much are we\\ntalking about literally\\nHow does 24000 gallons sound\\nOnce a week on a Wednesday a freight\\ntrain leaves the Port of Long Beach\\nloaded with industrial chemicals\\nTheres always at least one\\ntanker car full of methylamine\\nwhich we import from\\na manufacturer in Guangzhou\\nThe train travels east\\nthrough Arizona\\nstops at a rail yard\\noutside Flagstaff\\nwhere it gets broken down and rebuilt\\nBut the methylamine always moves on\\ndestined for our pesticide\\nconcerns in Texas and Oklahoma\\nWhich means that it passes\\nright through your home state\\nTheres a remote threemile stretch\\nhere in McKinley County\\nThats where you do it\\nThats where we do what exactly\\nGet your methylamine\\n Like rob it Like Jesse James\\n You want the stuff\\nIm offering you enough\\nto fill a swimming pool\\nYou are offering us a quick trip\\nto prison Thats what Im hearing\\nStopping a train post 911\\nYou have any idea how many alarms\\nthatll set off between here and DC\\nNone if you do it right here\\nIf a freight train is stopped in transit\\nanywhere other than\\nthe usual yards or depots\\nabsolutely a signal will alarm\\nthe FRA and the TSA Surface Division\\nat the Department of Homeland\\nSecurity But what you dont know\\nand I do because my job requires me\\nto keep track of my buyers shipments\\nthis is dark territory\\n Whats that\\n Trainspeak for an area of no contact\\nIts a dead zone\\nNo automated supervision system\\nno alarms no contact with control\\nWhat about cell phones\\n Crew could just call the cops\\n No cellular either\\nIm telling you its\\nthe perfect place\\nYoud have time enough\\nto stop the train\\nsiphon off as much methylamine\\nas you can carry\\n get away before the police are called\\n Wait a minute Wait a minute\\nAssuming we can stop\\na moving train\\nhow do we know we have the right\\none And which tanker car is which\\nI cant believe that they would\\nadvertise their contents\\nOnce the train gets\\nrebuilt in Flagstaff\\na final manifest gets uploaded\\nto my companys server\\nIll have it for you sometime\\nbetween midnight and 2 am\\nThatll give you at least\\nsix hours of lead time\\nKeep in mind Im taking a huge risk\\nsupplying this information\\nI expect to be paid\\nWe can talk percentages later\\nYou know what this means dont you\\nWeve gotta off the crew\\nHow do you figure\\nIf we dont the engineers\\ngonna call the cops\\nas soon as he gets out of the\\ndead zone Its only three miles long\\n Were way out in the boonies\\n I dont care if its in the Gobi Desert\\nOnce they get word\\nthe FBI and Homeland Security\\nare gonna swoop down with choppers\\non us so fast itll make our heads spin\\nAnd there is no hiding\\nin that open country\\n How many in the crew\\n Just two\\n An engineer and a conductor\\n Assuming there are no security guards\\nNo guards Its not like\\nwere carrying nuclear warheads\\nWait Two guys\\nCant we just tie\\nthem up or something\\nAnd then what Even if we wear a mask\\nwere leaving two witnesses behind\\nBottom line I have done this\\nlong enough to know\\nthat there are\\ntwo kinds of heists\\nThose where the guys\\nget away with it\\nand those that leave witnesses\\nGive me a break\\nYou guys were gonna murder me\\nI thought you were professionals\\nCan you say ASAC\\nASAC Can you say that\\nSay ASAC Schrader\\nIf those turn out to be her first\\nwords I will beat you with my shoe\\n Dont listen to him Holly\\n Im just telling it like it is babe\\nBoss man Im the boss man\\nSay Boss man\\nAm I the boss man Im the boss\\nHey that better be something from\\na boob instead of some fake soy crap\\n Yeah yeah\\n My little girl\\n Your little girl\\n deserves the real McCoy\\n No See\\n Okay\\nShe doesnt want it\\nNo she wants me\\nShe wants me\\nYeah my little girl\\nbecause Im not giving her back\\nYeah I know\\nWhat about Emo McGee\\nHas he come out\\nof his room today\\nBarely\\nWhen he does he barely talks\\nYeah well what do you expect\\nyou know\\nHis parents treat him\\nlike hes a baby there\\nFlynn do you want me to heat up\\nsome of that lasagne\\nto hold you over till dinner\\nNo\\nHey I picked up Heat on Bluray\\nWanna watch it with me later\\nNo And you can keep\\ntalking about me now\\nWell if no one else is gonna\\noffer an opinion I will\\nWe do it the oldfashioned way\\nWe hit skid row the Crystal Palace\\nall the halfway houses\\nscrounge up about a dozen skells\\nput them to work smurfing cold pills\\nYou mean switch back\\nto a pseudo cook\\nYoure the chemist Admittedly\\nits gonna cut down on our output\\nLike a factor of four or five\\nIt also means\\nthat we will eat 80000\\nwe just invested\\nin our new lab equipment\\nwhich is only\\ngood for a P2P cook\\nYou know I dont have to do\\nthe math to know\\nthat wed be making\\na fraction of the profit\\nAnd making less money\\nis better than making nothing\\nOh yeah Mike\\nWell why dont you tell us why\\nWhy is making nothing\\nnot an option\\n Walter\\n Let me tell you why\\nIts because of your nine guys\\nin lockup right\\nYou broke it you pay for it And weve\\ntalked about this plenty already\\nWell maybe we better\\ntalk about it a little more\\nbecause what it sounds like youre\\ntelling me Mike is that from now on\\nwe have no choice but to do\\nthis piddling pseudo cook\\nso that we can pay back\\nyour guys\\nOr else what Or else theyre gonna\\nrat on us and we end up in prison\\nYeah And it sounds like\\nwhat youre telling me Walter\\nis that you wanna\\ndo this heist\\neven if it means killing\\na couple of innocent men\\nThat what you want\\nYou know I dont know why you insist\\non putting words in my mouth here\\nWhat if we can rip off that train\\nand no one ever knows it got robbed\\nMaybe\\nJust maybe\\nItll come from that direction\\nSeven seventyfive\\nEight hundred\\nEight fourteen\\nWait a minute\\nIts perfect Yeah we do it here\\nWe do it right here\\nHow are we looking Mike\\nAll clear\\nCopy that\\nGo down go down\\nYou got it Thats good Fernando\\nHey\\n This one\\n Right\\n You good\\n Yeah\\n Whats your name again\\n Todd\\nTodd on the day are you gonna\\nbe able to make this climb\\nYes sir Ill be ready\\nAll right\\n You mind if I ask you a question\\n No Go ahead\\nWell I get why we want the tank\\nfor the methylamine\\nBut why this other\\none for the water\\nWell\\nJesse its your idea\\nYou wanna fill him in\\nIts all about the weight yo\\nThe tanker were gonna hit gets weighed\\nwhen it gets loaded in Long Beach\\nand then again\\nwhen its unloaded in Texas\\nIf the weights dont match\\nthe train companys\\ngonna know it got robbed\\nOkay\\nBoosting methylamine from a train\\nis like a major rap\\nThe point is no one other than us can\\never know that this robbery went down\\nNobody You got it\\nYeah Absolutely\\nAre you sure\\nYes sir\\nWith all that said\\nthe whole thing relies on us\\nreplacing the weight of methylamine\\nwe steal with the same weight in water\\nSo theyll never know\\nwe hit them Cool\\nAqueous methylamine is waterbased\\nyet it weighs slightly less than water\\nWe will be removing a thousand gallons\\nof methylamine from the tanker car\\nbut replacing it with about\\nninetenths of that volume in water\\nwhich comes to 90024 gallons\\nActually Jesse\\nlets make that an even 920\\nto account for spillage and\\nwhatever will remain in the hose\\n Yeah\\n How we doing by the way\\n Eight fifty Were almost there\\n All right\\nWont they figure they got robbed\\ngetting watereddown methylamine\\nWell out of 24000 gallons\\nitll only amount to about\\nfour percent dilution so\\nBut yes youre right\\nThey will notice\\nAt which point\\nthey will blame China\\nfor sending\\na marginally weaker batch\\nDamn you guys thought\\nof everything\\nFlynn\\nFlynn open the door\\nJust come out and talk to me\\nIm staying\\nThats all I have to say\\n Whats going on\\n You got what you wanted thats what\\nCongratulations\\nIts me Open up\\nCome on Junior\\nIm not gonna ask twice\\nWhat\\nYou know what\\nAre you seriously kicking me out\\nof my own house\\nAre you seriously doing that\\nWe are not kicking you\\nout of anywhere son\\nWe love you And this is your house\\nas much as it is ours\\nBut your mom and I need some time\\nalone and you know that\\n We explained that to you\\n You havent explained jack shit\\nYou want me out\\nExplain to me why\\nWhy do I have to go\\nto Uncle Hanks\\nGive me the exact reason\\nor Im not going anywhere\\nThis is not gonna be a debate\\nWhats going on\\nWhy cant anybody tell me anything\\nI want one good reason\\nBecause were your parents\\nand youre our child\\nThats reason enough\\nNow please do as I ask\\nNow\\nItll pass Hell understand\\nDont start Walt\\nI wont change my mind about you\\nEven\\nWell I dont accept that\\nYoure my wife\\nIm not your wife Im your hostage\\nBut since you insist\\non keeping me imprisoned\\nIll make you a deal\\nI will launder your money\\nIll keep your secrets\\nbut the kids will stay\\nat Hank and Maries\\nwhere they have\\na chance of being safe\\nI think youve seen too many movies\\nOur children are not in danger\\nJust a couple of days ago\\nyou told me that a man\\nheld a gun to your head\\nYou said it like it\\nwas a point of pride\\nTheres nothing you can say\\nthatll convince me\\nthere wont come a day that\\nsomebody will knock on that door\\nlooking to harm you or me\\nor all of us\\nAnd when that day comes\\nthe children cannot be here\\nYou agree to that\\nand I will be whatever kind\\nof partner you want me to be\\nOkay\\nBy the way\\nyoure visiting a therapist\\nfrom Rio Rancho Peter\\nLast name is up to

going\\nNow\\nWaters going in now\\nWere going with water now\\n Good\\n Yeah\\nAll right\\nOne two three\\nYou did remember\\nto put it in neutral right\\nYeah man Give me a little credit\\nYou sure youre not out of gas\\nI got a full tank here\\nYeah this doesnt make any sense\\nEverything looks good\\nWhy dont we just\\nkeep going over it\\nTheres gotta be\\nsomething loose somewhere\\nDamn

get out of there\\n Thank you mister Much obliged\\n Glad we could work that out for you\\n Yeah no problem\\n You want a ride into town\\nYeah Yeah Thanks\\nWalter they are back\\nin the locomotive\\nIf you do not abort right now\\nyou are gonna get us all busted\\n Ready\\n Yeah\\nMr White\\nHey\\nHold it Hold it steady\\nNow\\nClose it off Close it off\\nTodd Get off Get off\\nYeah bitch\\n We did it\\n Oh yeah\\nOh my\\n Okay okay Nice job\\n Yeah\\nNo No No\\nNoYou guys didnt tell me\\nthis stuff smells like cat piss\\nMan shit happens huh\\nI mean Im sorry\\nbut I had to do it\\nObviously I guess you\\nsee it different\\nSome of you\\nBut I didnt see any other choice\\nIve been thinking about this all\\nday going over it in my head\\nand it was the only way\\nWell its not like I wanted to\\nThe kid was on a dirt bike\\nHe couldve just\\nHe couldve gunned it and been gone\\nbefore we even had a chance to blink\\nWe never wouldve caught him\\nI thought on my feet I saw a threat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n and I took care of it\\n A threat\\nThe kid was waving at us\\nHe wasnt going anywhere\\nHe was saying hi\\n Yeah but you dont know that\\n Yeah I do\\n He didnt know what hed seen\\n I didnt want to take that chance\\nThe whole point of this was no one\\nwas supposed to know we were there\\nPeople werent supposed to\\nknow anything got robbed\\nHow could we let the kid go\\nHe made us If I hadnt done what I\\ndid the mission wouldve failed\\nIm real sorry\\nI really am but I\\nBut did I make a mistake Mr White\\nBecause to me you know respectfully\\nI was looking out for the team\\nI didnt want to kill him\\nYou gotta believe that\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day it was\\nhim or us and I chose us\\nAnd I would do it again\\nOkay look\\nTodd why dont you step outside for a\\nfew minutes so we can talk this through\\nOf course Yeah you guys talk\\nBut I just want to make sure that you\\nknow that my priority is this business\\nOkay Thats fine Todd Thank you\\nI want to be a real part of this\\nAll right If you could just see that\\nIm motivated and Ive got connections\\nMy uncles got his\\nhookups in prison\\nwho I think could be a real help\\nto us if\\nOkay That dude Wack job\\n Lets just stick to the facts here\\n Facts Oh okay\\nHow about the fact\\nthat he shot a kid\\nA kid that he didnt need to shoot\\nWell the boy had seen us\\nAnd no it didnt look like he knew\\nwhat he was seeing\\nBut what if he told somebody\\nWhat if he just mentioned it\\nin passing\\nWe cant know what someone\\nExactly We cant know\\nbecause Ricky Hitler there shot him\\nWe us three shouldve had\\na discussion about it\\nWe wouldve figured it out\\nBut that dickhead just went ahead\\nand made the choice for us\\n Is that how we do business now\\n I understand youre upset\\nAnd what was that crap about his\\nuncle with the prison connections\\nIts just some bullshit\\nintimidation move Come on\\nIts true though\\nHe does have some connections\\n Is this a problem\\n No Its nothing to be concerned about\\nIt came up in the background\\nI did on him\\nDidnt worry me then\\nHes just flexing\\nAll right\\nIt seems to me that\\nwe have three options here\\nand none of which are ideal\\nOne we fire Todd\\n Yeah\\n Im not a fan of this option\\nseeing that he knows way too much\\nabout this business at this point\\nAnd wed most likely have to pay him\\nto keep quiet\\nAnd God only knows\\nweve got enough of that going on\\nTwo\\nWe dispose of him\\nWhich leaves us option three\\nWe keep him on payroll\\nPut him back on tenting houses\\nsetting up the lab and so forth\\nWe keep him close\\nUnder our control\\nNow option three\\nwould be my choice\\nShall we vote\\nI vote three kid\\nYoure still in\\nRight on Thank you so much\\nYou guys totally made the right\\nThe next time you bring a gun\\nto a job without telling me\\nI will stick it up\\nyour ass sideways\\n You understand\\n Yes sir\\nHey boss Whats

good\\nto get it off your chest\\nOh yeah\\n I feel better\\n Yeah\\nFor those who love the taste\\nbut not the price\\ntheres simulated caviar\\nmade of kelp a type of seaweed\\nA fraction of the cost it looks smells\\nand tastes similar to the real thing\\nReady to get back at it\\nUnlike fish caviar\\nWe have breaking news\\ninto our newsroom\\nWeve just learned that police\\nare now expanding their search\\nfor a missing McKinley County boy\\nafter four days with no leads\\nFourteenyearold Drew Sharp was last\\nseen by his parents Thursday morning\\nAuthorities are extending\\ntheir search today\\neast from Crownpoint\\nto Hospah and Whitehorse\\nSharp was last seen riding his dirt\\nbike into the desert behind his house\\nInvestigators are asking any\\nJesse nothing can change this\\n Yeah its just that kids parents\\n I know Believe me\\nI havent been able to sleep the\\npast few nights just thinking about it\\nBut Jesse now finally\\nwere selfsufficient\\nFinally we have everything\\nthat we need\\nand no one to answer to\\nexcept ourselves\\nAnd in a year year and a half\\nonce weve cooked through this\\nmethylamine and made our money\\nthere will be plenty of time\\nfor soulsearching Until then\\nwe keep going\\nAnd we run our business our way\\nand make sure that this\\nnever happens again\\nOkay\\nLook\\nListen Ill finish this up\\nWhy dont you go on home\\n You sure\\n Absolutely\\nYeah Ill take care of this\\nYou go on\\nHey\\nYeah I was just leaving\\nAll right\\nHello Walter\\nWhat are you doing here\\nIm delivering the batch\\nWhat are you doing here\\nMight as well get this over with\\nCome in Join us\\n Hey\\n Hi\\nWheres your cars\\nWe parked around the block\\nYou might consider\\ndoing that as well\\nOkay\\nSo whats going on\\nJust since this morning I threw\\nthree separate tails All DEA\\n What\\n The feds have been all over me\\nThis has been going on\\nfor a while now\\nDid they follow you here\\nNo I said I threw them\\nI would never come to the headquarters\\nof our illegal meth operation\\ndragging a bunch of cops Walter\\n It would be unwise\\n How can you be so sure\\nWell Ive been doing this a long time\\nIts pretty basic stuff\\nHow long has this been going on\\nSince about the time we started\\nthis little venture\\nThe DEA in particular your peach\\nof a brotherinlaw\\nhas taken a keen interest\\nin my activities\\nAnd youre just telling me this now\\nWhat you didnt think this\\ninformation would be of interest\\n Wouldnt be germane\\n Ive been handling it Walter\\nWere sitting on a thousand gallons\\nof stolen methylamine\\nJesus\\nHow can you be so irresponsible\\nCalm down would you please\\nI cant believe that you kept this from me\\nFrom us Did you know about this\\n Mike just told me\\n And I said calm down\\n Ive got it under control\\n Oh well forgive me\\nfor not having\\ncomplete confidence\\n You know this cant go on right\\n Yeah I know\\nAnd Ive already decided\\nIm out\\nOkay Well\\nSorry to see you go Mike\\nBut I really dont\\nsee any other way\\nNeither do I\\nObviously Jesse\\nyoull have to take over\\nthe distribution end of things\\nMike I trust that youll bring Jesse up\\nto speed on your side of the business\\nYeah about that\\nActually Mr White\\nIm out too\\nYoure what\\nI dont think I can do this anymore\\nSo\\nIm retiring I guess\\nThat methylamine that we stole that we\\nnearly killed ourselves trying to steal\\nThat methylamine when cooked\\nis worth nearly 300 million\\nAnd youre telling me that youre\\nwilling to walk away from that\\nWere walking away from the meth\\nNot the methylamine\\nJesse and I will be taking\\nour twothirds and selling it\\nIve got a connection a guy I\\nknew from my time with Fring\\nThis guy has the capital\\nand hes motivated Highly\\nMikes thinking well clear\\nlike 5 million Each\\nIll pay off my guys in lockup\\nout of my share\\nAnd those legacy costs youre so fond of\\nyou wont have to worry about anymore\\nAnd then I will be going on my way\\nJesse too\\nIts a solid plan\\nYou can come in on this with us\\nThatd be cool\\nCourse you know you are free\\nto hold onto your third\\nand keep cooking\\nYoull be selling to my competitors\\nThis guy and his crew\\nare way out in Phoenix\\nIts a big country Walter\\nWhole lot of methheads\\nPennies on the dollar Jesse\\nAnd thats what youre\\ngonna sell out for\\nPennies Why\\nFive million isnt pennies\\nIts more money than Ive ever seen\\nAnd when it comes down to it\\nare we in the meth business\\nOr the money business\\nRelax kid Theres no one there\\nYou sure\\nI wouldnt be here if I wasnt\\nGlad to see you could make it out\\nI was surprised to get your call\\nGood surprise I hope\\nTheres one gallon as discussed\\nYou take that back home\\nto your people test it\\nIf youre satisfied\\nI can get the other 665\\nAll right Thats fair enough\\nShall we talk money\\nThat ones free\\nThe price for the rest\\nis 15000 per\\nSix hundred and sixtyfive gallons\\nthats 9975000\\nAlthough I would prefer\\nyou round it up to 10\\nMakes it easier for my partner\\nand I to split\\nSteep\\nWe good\\nIll talk to my guys but I should be\\nable to put together that cash yeah\\nGood\\nI gotta tell you this is worth it just to\\nget that blue stuff of yours off the market\\nThe blue stuff will be\\noff the market right\\nNow this whole time\\nI was thinking 666\\nthat seems like an odd number\\nTwothirds of an even\\nthousand though\\nWhen I look at it that way\\nit starts to make sense to me\\nThats not all the\\nmethylamine is it\\nYou two have a partner\\nyou havent mentioned\\nThis other party\\nwouldnt be a problem for you\\n His territory wont impact yours\\n You see that doesnt work for me\\nIm not just buying this for the supply\\nIm buying this for the demand\\nIm looking to increase\\nmy market share\\nWell I dont know what to tell you\\nI want you to tell me that Frings\\nblue will be off the streets\\nAll right\\nHeres a new deal for you then\\nIll pay you 15K a gallon\\nfor the full thousand gallons\\nNot a drop less\\nIts not mine to sell Declan\\nWell then no deal Mike\\nYes\\nYes I guess\\nI dont know\\nWhy dont you come over here\\nTo my house\\nYes seriously\\nHey\\nYo you sure this is okay\\nShes not here Nobodys here\\nAll right So\\nSomethings come up\\nMike wanted to come here\\nto give you the hard sell\\nbut I figured itd be better\\ncoming from me\\nMikes connection wont buy\\nmine and Mikes shares\\nof the methylamine\\nunless he gets your share too\\nHe wants the entire\\nthousand gallons\\nAbsolutely not\\nYeah I figured youd say that\\nBut Ive been thinking about it\\nand it really makes sense\\n Kind of\\n It does does it\\nLook when you started this thing\\ndid you ever dream\\nof having 5 million\\nI know for a fact that you didnt\\nI know for a fact all you needed\\nwas 737000\\nbecause you worked it all out\\nlike mathematically\\nLook if selling the methylamine now means\\nthat no one else ever gets killed\\nthen I vote for that man\\nHands down\\nAnd we could have it tomorrow\\nWe would be out\\nSpend time with your family No more\\nworrying about them getting hurt\\nor finding out about everything\\nIsnt this what youve been working for\\nI have not been working\\nthis hard just to sell out\\n Its not selling out\\n Yes it is Jesse\\nI have We have suffered and bled\\nliterally for this business\\nAnd I will not throw\\nit away for nothing\\nI dont know how else to say it\\nMr White\\nFive million dollars isnt nothing\\nJesse have you heard of a company\\ncalled Gray Matter\\n No\\n Well I cofounded it\\nin grad school with a couple\\nof friends of mine\\nActually I was the\\none who named it\\nAnd back then it was just\\nOh it was just smalltime\\nWe had a couple patents pending\\nBut nothing earthshattering\\nCourse we all knew the potential\\nYeah we were gonna take\\nthe world by storm\\nAnd then this\\nWell something happened\\nbetween the three of us\\nAnd Im not gonna go into detail\\nBut for personal reasons\\nI decided to leave the company\\nAnd I sold my share\\nto my two partners\\nI took a buyout for 5000\\nNow at the time\\nthat was a lot of money for me\\nCare to guess what that company\\nis worth now\\nMillions\\nBillions with a B\\nTwopointonesix billion\\nas of last Friday\\nI look it up every week\\nAnd I sold my share\\nmy potential for 5000\\nI sold my kids birthright\\nfor a few months rent\\nThis isnt the same thing\\nJesse you asked me\\nif I was in the meth business\\nor the money business\\nNeither\\nIm in the empire business\\nI dont know\\nMr White is a meth empire really\\nsomething to be that proud of\\nSkyler you remember Jesse\\nJesse this is my wife Skyler\\nHey Mrs White Good to see you\\nYou have a lovely home\\n I was just heading out\\n Why dont you stay for dinner\\n No Mr White Im gonna go\\n Stay\\nCome on Itll be fun\\nIts okay with us isnt it Skyler\\nWe dont have anything special\\nplanned tonight\\nYeah\\nSure\\nWhy not\\nSee\\nThese are great green beans\\nMrs White\\nI like that you got\\nthe slivered almonds going\\nMy mom always made them like that\\nYou put lemon in there too\\nThey are from the\\ndeli at Albertsons\\nWell\\nyou know good work\\non your shopping then\\nBecause these are choice\\nI eat a lot of frozen stuff\\nIts usually pretty bad\\nI mean the pictures\\nare always so awesome you know\\nIts like Hell yeah\\nIm stoked for this lasagna\\nAnd then you nuke it and the\\ncheese gets all scabby on top\\nand its like\\nyoure eating a scab\\nI mean seriously\\nwhats that about\\nIts like yo whatever happened\\nto truth in advertising\\nYou know\\nYeah its bad\\nSo hey hows business\\nThe car wash Mr White said\\nits going really well\\nSays like youre a great manager\\nHe did huh\\nYeah he says youve\\ngot it running like a\\nLike a machine Like welloiled\\nYeah\\nWhat else did he tell you about me\\nOh you know just good stuff\\nJust really you know\\nreally good good stuff\\nWe dont really talk\\nthat much about\\nyou know personal things\\nDid you also tell him\\nabout my affair\\nMay I please be excused\\nYou know my kids are gone\\nThank God\\nNo I dont mean\\ntheyre out for the night\\nTheyre gone\\nTheyre staying with my inlaws\\nShe made me kick\\nmy own kids out of the house\\nShe told me\\nthat she was counting the days\\nuntil my cancer came back\\nMy wife is waiting for me to die\\nThis business is all\\nI have left now\\nIts all I have\\nAnd you want to take\\nit away from me\\nI thought you might try\\nsomething stupid\\n Look Mike\\n Dont bother Walter\\nCome join me in the office\\nI dont think so\\nThats not a request\\nMight as well get comfortable\\nThis deals going down tomorrow\\nIts happening and theres nothing\\nyou can do to stop it\\n Got it\\n So its okay for you to steal my\\nTo ensure that\\nyou and I are gonna spend\\nthe rest of the night together\\nin this office\\n Like its my birthday\\n Mike\\nWhen the deal is done youll\\nget your money I guarantee that\\nLet me cook it Ill double\\nyour five and you still walk\\nYou know I have never seen anybody\\nwork so hard not to get 5 million\\nMike you need to listen to me\\nNo Walter The last thing I need to\\ndo is listen to you Now sit down\\nAll right\\nWalter Ive got a bit\\nof a quandary here\\nIve got something I need to attend\\nto before this deal happens\\nBut for some reason I dont trust\\nyou alone with the methylamine\\nIm gonna have to restrain you\\nYou gotta be kidding\\nStand up for me please\\nStand up\\nTurn around for me\\nArms out to the side Up\\n Oh man\\n Sit down\\nSit down\\nGive me your wrist\\n30\\nAlrighty\\nTo what do we owe the pleasure\\nWell gentlemen were here to discuss\\nyour illegal harassment of my client\\nThis should be good\\nMr Ehrmantraut has become the\\nsubject of a vicious relentless\\nand unwarranted DEA persecution\\n Gomie does that sound right to you\\n I have no idea what hes talking about\\nPlay it as cool as you like Fonzie\\nBut we all know youve been\\nfollowing my client day and night\\nThe man cant spend a few minutes\\nwith his granddaughter\\nwithout you guys quivering\\nin the bushes\\nand peeping through your binoculars\\nIts Well its disturbing\\nAnd its taken a toll on his mental\\nand physical wellbeing\\nYour client looks fine to me\\nWell some hurts only show\\non the inside\\nNow you guys dont even have\\nwarrants for these tails do you\\nTheoretically\\nthese tails you refer to would be\\nwithin the bounds of the law\\nWe dont need a warrant to follow\\nsomebody through a public place\\n Theoretically\\n Yeah that is theoretically correct\\nHowever I would counter that an\\nopenended unrestricted surveillance\\nlike this amounts to stalking\\nWhich is illegal\\nNow I dont know what it is\\nyou find so interesting\\nabout my client\\nand Im not here to judge\\nDifferent strokes and all\\nBut sadly hes just not that into you\\nSo I have filed for a temporary\\nrestraining order\\nagainst the DEA\\non behalf of Mr Ehrmantraut\\nWhered you get your law degree\\nGoodman\\nThe same clown college\\nyou got that suit\\nYou know who likes this suit\\nJudge Papadoumian\\nShe thinks Im a snappy dresser\\nYou know what\\nJudge Papadoumian hates\\nPolice harassment of\\na senior citizen\\n30\\nExpect a visit from\\nthe sheriff agents\\nYou should have your ex parte\\nwithin the hour\\nLets go\\nWhat kind of judge\\nwould issue this thing\\nPapadoumian man\\nShes like Ho Chi Minh\\nSo what do we do\\nWell not a lot of choice you know\\nWe back off\\nFor the moment TRO wont stand up\\nand Goodman knows it\\nI dont see what theyre playing at here\\nbut if Ehrmantraut wants a fight\\n hes gonna get one\\n All right\\n That was a hell of a gamble\\n Worked\\nYeah well not for long\\nAnd hes right about that TRO\\nIts gonna get tossed tout de suite\\nMeanwhile Schraders hardon for you\\njust reached Uncle Miltie proportions\\nSo have fun with that\\nHow much time I got\\nMaybe 24 hours\\nIts enough\\nIt better be Whatever you got\\nplanned you best pull the ripcord\\nwhile you still have a chance\\n Where is it\\n Mike\\n Mike\\n Get out of my way\\nYou sit down\\n Mike Mike Hold on okay\\n I am gonna count to three\\nMr Whites got an idea\\nMike Im serious\\n One Two\\n Its a great idea\\nLook you get your 5 million we both do\\nand he gets his methylamine all right\\nJust hear him out\\nIs that true Walter\\nEverybody winsThere\\nThats them\\nYour play Walter\\nYoure on your own\\nLooks like youre about 1000 gallons\\nlight here Mike\\nWheres the juice\\nThe methylamine isnt coming\\nWhy is that\\n And who the hell are you\\n Im the man whos keeping it\\nWhat the hells this\\nWe had an agreement right\\nWe got our deal\\nSo wheres the tank Mike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMike doesnt know where it is\\nOnly I do\\nAnd youre dealing with me now\\nnot him\\nWhy dont you just cut\\nto what it is you want\\nor what you think\\nis gonna happen here all right\\nBecause were gonna get\\nwhat we came for\\nThat 1000 gallons of methylamine\\nis worth more in my hands\\nthan it is in yours or\\nanyone elses for that matter\\nBut I need distribution\\nDistribution\\nThats right\\nSo if you agree\\nto give up your cook\\nand sell my product instead\\nIll give you 35\\npercent of the take\\nThirtyfive percent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWow are you kidding me\\nThirtyfive\\nMike please tell me this is a joke\\nKnow how far we had to stick our necks\\nout to get our hands on this cash\\nWhy the hell would we want you You\\nknow we have our own operation right\\nI know all about your operation\\nSee my partners here tell me\\nthat you produce a meth\\nthats 70 percent pure\\nif youre lucky\\nWhat I produce is 991 percent pure\\nSo\\nSo its grade school Tball\\nversus the New York Yankees\\nYours is just some tepid\\noffbrand generic cola\\nWhat Im making is Classic Coke\\nAll right Okay\\nSo if we just waste you\\nright here right now\\nand leave you in the desert\\nthen there is no more Coke\\non the market right\\nSee how that works Theres only us\\nDo you really wanna live\\nin a world without CocaCola\\nMy partner tells me\\nthat your crew\\nswitched to a P2P cook\\nbecause of our success\\nYou dye your meth with food colouring\\nto make it look like mine\\nYou already ape my product\\nat every turn\\nBut now\\nyou have the opportunity\\nto sell it yourself\\nI need you to listen to me\\nWere not gonna give up this deal\\nto be your errand boys\\ndo you understand\\nFor what\\nTo watch a bunch of junkies\\nget a better high\\nA better high\\nmeans customers pay more\\nA higher purity means\\na greater yield\\nThats 130 million\\ndollars of profit\\nthat isnt being pissed away\\nby some substandard cook\\nNow you listen to me\\nYouve got the greatest meth\\ncook in A No the two\\ngreatest meth cooks in America\\nright here and with our skills\\nyoull earn more\\nfrom that 35 percent\\nthan you ever would on your own\\nYeah So you say\\nJust wondering why were so lucky\\nWhy cut us in\\nMike is retiring from our crew\\nso his share of the partnership\\nis available\\nif you can handle his end\\ndistribution\\nand if you give him 5 million dollars\\nof the 15 million that you brought today\\nJust think of it as a finders fee\\nfor bringing us together\\nWe have 40 pounds of product\\nready to ship ready to go\\nAre you ready\\nWho the hell are you\\nYou know\\nYou all know exactly who I am\\nSay my name\\nDo what I dont have a damn clue\\nwho the hell you

a\\nfraction of FBI totals\\nWere lobbying Congress\\nfor an additional 141\\nbut were waiting on action\\nreports to demonstrate\\nwe re actually getting worthwhile\\nresults Our undercover operations\\nreap the most successful\\nactionable intelligence\\nif you refer to the chart\\nin Appendix 4\\nIf ASAC Schrader can tell us about\\nthe surveillance manhours   \\nHank\\nHank\\nHank\\nI

Yes sir\\n I know how good you are\\nI wouldnt have stuck my neck out\\nto get you here if I didnt\\nBut youre not knocking down\\ndoors anymore bubba\\nYoure in charge of a district office\\nand that comes with responsibilities\\nI mean Hank basic reports arent\\nbeing filed in a timely manner\\nIll work on it Itll get better\\nYeah it will because way too much\\ntime and money\\nis being spent on the Fring case\\na case which is essentially over\\nAll this overtime to surveil\\nMichael Ehrmantraut\\nThats just money that could\\nbe better spent elsewhere\\nI understand but Im not making\\nthese choices lightly\\nWeve got increased reports\\nof blue meth on the street\\nFrings gang is still operational and\\nEhrmantraut is involved Its that simple\\nI believe you But so what\\nIts one case out of dozens\\nand you dont play favourites\\n with it because it used to be yours\\n I really think\\nDont play favourites\\nYou got a bigger job than that\\nI mean forget the financial cost\\nI hear youre personally serving\\nsearch warrants out in the field\\nThat was an error in judgment\\nWont happen again\\nYoure damn right it wont\\nIm just gonna bottomline this for you\\nThe surveillance budget for\\nEhrmantraut is now zero We clear\\nSure Thank you\\n Clear\\n Good\\nWell be in touch\\nYeah\\n Hey\\n Hey\\nSo Ramey wanted\\nto catch up with you\\nTalk sports and stuff I guess\\nYeah something like that\\nNo more following Ehrmantraut\\nNot worth the financial investment\\nWell its not like\\nthe guys going anywhere\\nHes not even bothering\\nto throw our tails anymore\\nHes just living a boring oldman life\\nlike he has nothing left to hide\\n And none of Frings crew is talking\\n Not giving an inch\\nYou sweeten the pot enough\\nZero jail time and an\\nallexpensepaid trip to Maui\\nNot that but close\\nNobody wants to bite\\nChrist\\nTheyre either the most loyal crew in\\nhistory or someones paying them off\\n You still checking bank records\\n No one living beyond their means\\nNine perps all being represented\\nby one lawyer\\nNot unusual in a case like this\\nYeah this guy whats his name\\nDaniel Wachsberger\\nHe represents every one of these\\ndouche bags except for Ehrmantraut\\nCan we find out more\\nabout the lawyer\\nYou want me to start\\ntailing a lawyer\\nLike the shit aint deep enough\\nfor you already\\nRamey said we couldnt\\nfollow Ehrmantraut\\nHe didnt say anything\\nabout anybody else\\nDo it\\nYoure the boss\\nAll right Shall we get started\\nNow I know that most of this\\nor all of this is gonna be new to

client will supply information\\nrelating to the organisation\\ndistribution and production of\\nFrings methamphetamine enterprise\\nWe expect all charges to be dropped\\nand Dennis not only walks out of here\\na free man\\nbut also receives blanket immunity\\nFor what hell be furnishing\\nthis deal is plenty fair\\nBest Id be willing to do is queen\\nfor a day and reduced charges\\nAll charges dropped\\nQueen for a day and a fivek\\nThats the best youre gonna get\\nNo way Guys come on\\nYou can be a fairy princess\\nfor all I care\\nWhere you going\\nShopping for someone who can tell me\\nsomething I dont already know\\nHey he\\nI got plenty you dont know\\nYou seem a little confused\\nThis here is a buyers market\\nI got eight other assholes just like you\\nfour of them within

something\\n Do you want a coffee or something\\n Not just now\\nI think this would play better\\nif you ordered something\\nI think this will play just fine\\nand Im not thirsty\\nSo lets take a look at the list\\nLydia youve come all this way\\nYou do have the list\\n Yes I have it\\n Good\\nIts just not written down\\n And why is that\\n Its in my head Safer there\\nI see\\nThen I suggest you pick up a pen\\nNot just yet\\nIt was my understanding that\\nattending to these nine names\\nwas precisely what you wanted\\nTen names now\\nTen counting the lawyer\\nYes Ten counting the lawyer\\nSo what am I not tying up loose\\nends for our mutual benefit\\nYoure tying up loose ends\\nand I dont wanna be one of them\\nI give you that list\\nIve served my purpose\\nThen maybe Im just one more person\\nwho knows too much\\nSo you put that list in my hands\\nand in your mind\\nI immediately just murder you\\njust right here in this restaurant\\n No Not right here Of course\\n Here in this public place immediately\\n That is not\\n Listen Lydia\\nYou made me promise on my childrens\\nlives that I guaranteed your safety\\nFrom Mike\\nYou guaranteed\\nId be safe from Mike\\nTheres no way hed ever go for\\nthis you getting rid of his guys\\nYou wouldnt be doing this the\\nnames if Mike were still a factor\\nYeah Thats what I thought\\nWhat do you want exactly\\nBecause if you dont want\\nto give me that list\\nthen Ive truly\\ngot no use for you\\nI can grow your business\\nexponentially\\nJust give me the list\\nI can do that by helping you\\nexpand into a larger\\nhighly active highly profitable\\nmarketplace\\nWhat do you know\\nabout the Czech Republic\\nThe Czech Republic\\nDid you know theres a higher demand\\nfor meth there than anywhere in Europe\\nFive percent of its\\n10 million people\\nwhich is roughly the population\\nof the Southwest\\nfrom western Texas to Phoenix\\nare using meth\\nYou keep your market here\\nbut by adding overseas sales\\nyou can more than double\\nyour current profits\\nAnd I checked The average purity\\nis only about 60 percent\\nTheyve never seen\\nanything like your product\\nYoull blow their hair back\\nShipping internationally\\nseems like courting disaster\\nNot if youre Madrigal\\nMadrigal is under investigation\\nby the DEA\\nThe restaurant division mostly\\nWeve got 46000 employees\\nspread across 14 divisions\\nAnd once Mikes people are no longer a\\nfactor things should tidy up nicely\\nThis is what I do you understand\\nMove things from point A to point B\\nall over the globe\\nOnepointtwo million\\nmetric tons a month\\nand all of it right at my\\nfingertips a laptop click away\\nThe Czech Republic\\n Whos on the other end\\n People I ship to regularly\\nPeople Ive worked with for years\\nProfessional and very amenable\\nIm very careful who I work with\\nAnd if this is such a slam dunk\\nthen why didnt you pitch it to Fring\\nI did He said yes We were in the\\nfinal stages of working it out\\nwhen somebody killed him\\nYou dont think Gus Fring built his\\ndistribution network all by himself\\nThere are considerable advantages\\nto diversification of distribution\\nlike putting 6000 miles\\nbetween you and your product\\nAt 25 pounds a week Im estimating\\nyoull gross about 2 million\\nGive me 10 pounds to start\\nand well see how it goes\\n All right\\n Now with Fring\\nmy end was gonna be 30 percent\\nwhich I believe is more than fair\\n Okay\\n Trust me if you do this\\nLydia learn to take\\nyes for an answer\\nNow first things first\\nShake on it\\nWere going to make\\na lot of money together\\nTodd I think its time\\nI meet your uncle\\nNo iron pile\\nTheres too many muscleheads\\nflexing their shit Too many eyes\\nOkay so no chow line no yard\\nWell gonna keep it simple\\nPassbyes\\nYeah Hallways\\nshower room cells\\nThe easy stuff\\nI say we go with a riot\\nOur boys get it done in a riot\\nNo no no No chaos\\nI dont want the goon

walking window after lunch\\nYeah Its gonna be tight\\nReal tight\\nI gotta be straight with you man\\nTaking out all these guys is doable\\nBut hitting them in three separate\\njails all within two minutes\\nI mean whacking bin Laden\\nwasnt this complicated\\nWhere do you suppose\\nthese come from\\nIve seen this one before\\nI wonder\\nare they all In some giant\\nwarehouse someplace\\nHey\\nIt can be done\\njust not the way you want it\\nIt can be done exactly\\nhow I want it\\nThe only question is\\nare you the man to do it\\nFigure it out\\nThats what Im paying you

man\\nand admit what youve done\\nThats it\\nThere is no other option\\nLets go\\nMy name is\\nWalter Hartwell White\\nI live at\\n308 Negra Arroyo Lane\\nAlbuquerque New Mexico 87104\\nThis is my confession\\nIf youre watching this tape\\nIm probably dead\\nmurdered by my brotherinlaw\\nHank Schrader\\nHank has been building\\na meth empire\\nfor over a year now\\nand using me as his chemist\\nShortly after my 50th birthday\\nhe asked that I use\\nmy chemistry knowledge\\nto cook methamphetamine\\nwhich he would then sell\\nusing connections that he made\\nthrough his career\\nwith the DEA\\nI was astounded\\nI\\nI always thought\\nHank was a very moral man\\nand I was particularly\\nvulnerable at the time\\nsomething he knew\\nand took advantage of\\nI was reeling\\nfrom a cancer diagnosis\\nthat was poised\\nto bankrupt my family\\nHank took me on a ridealong\\nand showed me\\njust how much money\\neven a small meth operation\\ncould make\\nAnd I was weak\\nI didnt want my family\\nto go into financial ruin\\nso I agreed\\nHank had a partner\\na businessman\\nnamed Gustavo Fring\\nHank sold me into\\nservitude to this man\\nand when I tried to quit\\nFring threatened my family\\nI didnt know where to turn\\nEventually Hank and Fring\\nhad a falling out\\nand things escalated\\nFring was able to arrange\\nuh I guess I guess\\nyou call it a hit on Hank\\nand failed\\nbut he was seriously injured\\nand I wound up\\npaying his medical bills\\nwhich amounted\\nto a little over 177000\\nUpon recovery\\nHank was bent on revenge\\nWorking with a man\\nnamed Hector Salamanca\\nhe plotted to kill Fring\\nThe bomb that he used\\nwas built by me\\nAnd he gave me no option\\nin that\\nI have often\\ncontemplated suicide\\nbut Im a coward\\nI wanted to go to the police\\nbut I was frightened\\nHank had risen\\nto become the head\\nof the Albuquerque DEA\\nto keep me in line\\nhe took my children\\nFor three months he kept them\\nMy wife who had no idea\\nof my criminal activities\\nwas horrified to learn\\nwhat I had done\\nI was in hell\\nI hated myself for what\\nI had brought upon my family\\nRecently I tried\\nonce again to quit\\nand in response\\nhe gave me this\\nI cant take this anymore\\nI live in fear every day\\nthat Hank will kill me\\nor worse hurt my family\\nAll I could think to do\\nwas to make this video\\nand hope that the world\\nwill finally see this man\\nfor what he really is\\nWho do you think\\nhes shown this to\\nNo one\\nIts a threat\\nIts what he will do\\nif I dont back off\\nI think you should\\nshow this to Ramey\\nJust get ahead of it\\nThat video\\nis a bunch of lies Hank\\nAnybody who knows\\nyou will know\\n177000\\nHells he talking about\\nMarie\\nThey told me\\nit was gambling money\\nWhat was gambling money\\nOh Jesus Christ Marie\\nOh God no\\nHow was I supposed to know\\nHow was I supposed to know\\nwhere it really came from\\nWhy were they paying\\nfor my medical bills\\nWhat about my insurance\\nInsurance wouldnt have covered\\nthe treatment that you needed\\nand I\\nI just wanted the best for you\\nWhy didnt you tell me\\nBecause I knew that\\nyou would refuse it\\nand without it you may never\\nhave been able to walk again\\nOh Christ Marie\\nYou killed me here\\nI mean its the\\nthats the last nail\\nThats the last nail\\nin the coffin\\nWhat do we do\\nIf I were you\\nId be more nervous\\nUgh Jesus\\nIts always a desert\\nUh I already checked it\\nIts clean I wouldnt have\\ndriven it here if it wasnt\\nGet one of these\\nby the way\\nReads radio signals\\nMuch easier\\nWhat does he know\\nI mean he knows\\nyoure Heisenberg\\nBut I figure not much else\\notherwise you know\\nyoud be locked up\\nWhat did he say exactly\\nHe wants me to inform on you\\nfor him\\nTell him everything we did\\nAnything else\\nI dont think hes told\\nthe rest of the DEA\\nWhy do you say that\\nJust him being there\\nall by himself and\\nplus he was\\nacting kinda shady\\nSeemed like he didnt\\nwant the other cops\\nhearing what he had to say\\nAre we gonna talk about\\nthe rain of caca\\nthe kid brought down upon us\\nDo you want to hazard a guess\\nwhat his little\\ncharity drive cost you\\nWhy dont you go\\ntake a walk Saul\\nJesse will you\\nlet me help you\\nI dont like to see you\\nhurting like this\\nMaybe its time for a change\\nWhat kinda change\\nI dont know\\nI dont know\\nMaybe\\nMaybe its time for you\\nto just\\nleave all of this behind\\nJust get out of town\\nDont look back\\nSaul knows a man\\nHe specializes in giving\\npeople new identities\\nHe would move you\\nsomeplace far away\\nand set you up with\\na whole new life\\nYeah I know\\nSounds a little extreme\\nBut maybe its exactly\\nwhat you need\\nYou know I really think\\nthat would be good for you\\nA clean slate\\nAll right\\nJust think about it\\nYou get a job Something legitimate\\nSomething you like\\nMeet a girl\\nStart a family even\\nHell youre still so damn young\\nAnd whats here\\nfor you now anyway\\nI tell ya\\nIf I could Id trade places\\nA whole lifetime ahead of you\\nwith a chance to hit\\nthe reset button\\nIn a
